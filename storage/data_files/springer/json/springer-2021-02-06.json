		"abstract": "Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) aims to improve peoples quality of life through the use of information technologies. Due to the critical nature of AAL systems, quality is a priority. However, as AAL is a relatively new domain, its main limitation is the lack of consensus and standardization in quality assessment. This work presents a systematic review to determine the state of the art on the quality assessment of AAL systems from a multidimensional vision (software product, in use, data and context). Initially, 1308 primary studies were extracted, from them 21 relevant studies related to models, frameworks, taxonomies and other approaches of quality assessment were selected after applying the corresponding inclusion and exclusion criteria. The selected studies were subject to a comparative analysis that determined the most recurrent and critical quality attributes for AAL systems, being an important contribution to generate consensus in the construction of more complete quality models. Furthermore, this work allowed to recognize the strengths and limitations of the quality proposals studied and to identify research gaps and challenges.",

		"abstract": "Ambient assisted living (AAL) environments are augmented with sensing and communication technologies to support elderly people with personalized, adaptive and anticipatory requirements. A plethora of heterogeneous devices and services appear and disappear, which expose different behavior with the changing contexts in these environments. Therefore, a service matchmaking mechanism that attempts to identify relevant services in order to fulfill the user needs, has to deal with the heterogeneity of devices and services along with their dynamic behavior. Existing service specifications, such as semantic web services, are often used to abstract the environments functionalities and the user tasks without incorporating context-aware properties, which makes them unsuitable for service matchmaking in pervasive and ambient environment. To deal with these issues, we introduce a contExt Aware web Service dEscription Language (wEASEL) that is an abstract service model to represent services and user tasks in AAL environments. Also, we present a set of wEASEL-based service matching algorithms and evaluate them for their suitability. The proposed service matchmaking mechanism can incorporate services that are available in local AAL environment as well as in the cloud computing marketplace.",

Though the facts motivating the need for AAL are indisputable, the inherently heterogeneous nature and requirements of the elderly population raise significant difficulties. One particular challenge is that of designing AAL systems that can evolve to meet the requirements of individuals as their needs and circumstances change. This demands the availability of an adaptive, open, scalable software platform that incorporates a select combination of autonomic and intelligent techniques. Given that the first generation of AAL systems will be deployed in the near future, it is incumbent on designers to factor this need for evolution and adaptivity in their designs and implementations. Thus this paper explores AAL from a number of prospective and considers an agent-based middleware approach to realising an architecture for evolutionary AAL.",

		"abstract": "A self-adaptive software system modifies its behavior at runtime in response to changes within the system or in its execution environment. The fulfillment of the system requirements needs to be guaranteed even in the presence of adverse conditions and adaptations. Thus, a key challenge for self-adaptive software systems is assurance. Traditionally, confidence in the correctness of a system is gained through a variety of activities and processes performed at development time, such as design analysis and testing. In the presence of self-adaptation, however, some of the assurance tasks may need to be performed at runtime. This need calls for the development of techniques that enable continuous assurance throughout the software life cycle. Fundamental to the development of runtime assurance techniques is research into the use of models at runtime (M@RT). This chapter explores the state of the art for using M@RT to address the assurance of self-adaptive software systems. It defines what information can be captured by M@RT, specifically for the purpose of assurance, and puts this definition into the context of existing work. We then outline key research challenges for assurance at runtime and characterize assurance methods. The chapter concludes with an exploration of selected application areas where M@RT could provide significant benefits beyond existing assurance techniques for adaptive systems.",

Evidence suggests that AALTs empower the elderlys involvement with their surroundings, and hence; improves the quality of their living. Therefore, public service organizations (e.g. The Saudi Alzheimers Disease Association (ALZ)) have been established with the aim to raise awareness about AD, in order to reach a comfortable lifestyle for all elders with AD. Moreover, this fact is the motivation behind addressing our problem in the paper. Each AALT has its own special requirements in usage, care, extensibility, reusability, scalability and adaptability. More importantly, there are many other factors that have great influence on those requirements. In this paper we will investigate some of these factors, such as: the environment, the caregivers experience, and the elders age, culture, and social structure. Furthermore, adaptability and cultural factors are the pivots of our study, to show their influence on designing AALT and specifying their requirements.",

		"abstract": "Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is a promising and fast growing area of technologies and services to assist people with special needs (e.g. elderly or disabled) in managing more independently their everyday life. AAL is founded on increasing needs for welfare technologies, as well as on significant effort from many scientific disciplines, the society, and the industry. The research has so far been primarily concentrated on elicitation of the functional aspects and on providing the technical solutions for the AAL systems and services. The problem of eliciting non-functional requirements and quality characteristics that are specific and critical for AAL, however, has been addressed to a much lesser extent. Failing to ensure the necessary system and service quality regarding critical characteristics may represent a significant obstacle to the wider acceptance of AAL in the society. There is hence a need to increase awareness of quality of AAL systems and services by providing the necessary supplement to the established state of the art. This paper reports on the process and the results from elicitation of AAL specific quality characteristics. The approach is based on established reference architectures and roadmapping material, as well as the ISO/IECÂ 9126 software product quality standard. The paper demonstrates how to do the elicitation in practice, and proposes the set of quality characteristics that are most important in the AAL context.",

These systems work in real time and their correct operation depends on the inferred knowledge of the data collected from sensors or other sources, thus the assurance of the quality of data is a priority aspect, especially in those systems that can put in risk the life of people. Currently, the research in this line is limited, there are not data quality models with a complete set of attributes and metrics adjusted to the AAL domain. This work proposes a data quality model for AAL systems conformed by the following characteristics: accuracy, completeness, currentness, confidentiality, accessibility, understandability and compliance; and their corresponding metrics. Finally, the application of the model to an intelligent pillbox, showed that it is a complete and valuable tool to evaluate the degree to which the quality of data is reached and preserved by an AAL system.",

One of the most crucial parts of AAL development is the integration of the different developed components to a functional cohesive platform.

The USEFIL AAL system was conceived as a platform utilizing low cost off-the-shelf technology and providing an independent and healthy lifestyle to elderly people. This platform like several AAL platforms reached its system integration stage consisting of relatively few components. In that context technological hurdles have been resolved in the development process of each component. For that reason in the present work the focus is on relatively simple but crucial observations from the field taken during the USEFIL AAL platforms integration effort. The resulting guidelines for integration of AAL platforms are: A) Managerial clarity: Clearly defined roles both cross and within teams, robust avenues of interpersonal communication, detailed and flexible fiscal planning. B) Testing diligence: No assumptions should be made about the robustness of components or the triviality of tests. Component interconnection may lead to unexpected loss of functionality. C) Iterative functional testing: In the case of AAL systems with complex AI components the introduction of additional infrastructure may lead to significant differentiation in functionality a thing that needs to be tested and corrected if detected. D) Pre-pilot testing objectivity: Pre pilot users testing the AAL platform should be provided with minimal training in order to interact with the system as an ordinary user. Only that way they can provide genuinely original feedback. These guidelines while non-technical proved essential for the integration of USEFIL and could serve as a primer for avoiding pitfalls in the integration of similar AAL systems.",

		"abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) applications nowadays generate a large amount of data, which are continually requiring adequate treatment and services on the Cloud to be available to stakeholders. Healthcare applications manage critical data from different sources as patient charts, Electronic Health Record (EHR), and devices which need security levels, data formatting, and quality of data due to their importance and sensitivity. Data as a Service (DaaS) is a data management framework provided though services on Cloud to bring data storage, integration, processing, analysis services, security, availability, elasticity, and quality characteristics to the data concerning the stakeholders. In this context, this paper proposes a data management solution deployed as DaaS for the healthcare domain presented through a metamodel focused on the federation pattern of data based on an Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) model for data classification; and considering a brief analysis of the non-functional characteristics proper of the DaaS domain as the security, confidentiality, priority, and availability. The metamodel is validated through an instantiation process using the MOntreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) test as the entry. Finally, it is presented a discussion from four stakeholder perspectives (e.g., data engineer, IoT solution developer, data quality analyst, health professional) about the solution.",

However, the loss of physical functions (such as mobility, eyesight and hearing), as well as the loss of cognitive functions (starting from amnesia to severe disabilities as dementia or Alzheimer), require appropriate solutions in order to offer personalised assistive tasks according to user needs and characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology that is based on the integration of a service-oriented approach with normative reasoning to automatically generate assistive tasks customised for different target users profiles, and deployable in any AAL environment. The formalisation of the conceptual steps of the methodology is provided, together with a framework implementing them. The advantages of dynamic customisation obtained by decoupling the functional and not functional aspects of assistive technology are shown through a validation scenario.",

Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), which is largely based on Ubiquitous Computing, aims at tutoring and supervising elderly people and users with physical, sensory or cognitive disabilities in the performance of routine household activities. AALs main aim is to increase the autonomy of dependent people in their daily life by providing them with supportive instructions for everyday routines and warnings about home safety issues. This concept can be extended to public spaces, where ubiquitous accessible services allow people with disabilities to access location-dependent web services (providing maps, addresses, transport schedules, etc.) and local intelligent machines (such as information kiosks or ATMs). This approach allows existing knowledge about the users, their common activities, and their environment to be used to extend the in-home AAL concept to the support of common routines performed outside the home. This chapter surveys the modelling techniques used inside the home and discusses the methodologies required for their extension for out-of-home use, including interoperation and sharing of models.",

The social robot is the most visible component of the system playing the role of communication interface between the elderly, the smart home, and the external world. The robots behavior is determined in part by sensor information gathered through the smart home. To ensure user acceptance, we used user-centered design to implement the robots behavior.

A challenge long solved by control theory for continuous-behaviour systems was thus reopened in the realm of software systems. Software engineering needs to embark on a quest for self-adaptive high-integrity software. This paper explains the growing need for software capable of both self-adaptation and high integrity, and explores the starting point for the quest to make it a reality.

One of the key areas of the IoT is the Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems, which should be able to react to variable and continuous changes while ensuring their acceptance and adoption by users. This means that AAL systems need to work as self-adaptive systems. The autonomy property inherent to software agents, makes them a suitable choice for developing self-adaptive systems. However, agents lack the mechanisms to deal with the variability present in the IoT domain with regard to devices and network technologies. To overcome this limitation we have already proposed a Software Product Line (SPL) process for the development of self-adaptive agents in the IoT. Here we analyze the challenges that poses the development of self-adaptive AAL systems based on agents. To do so, we focus on the domain and application engineering of the self-adaptation concern of our SPL process. In addition, we provide a validation of our development process for AAL systems.",

However, to date, many of these advances have been largely driven by technology-utopian visions without real understanding for how such technologies come to be situated in everyday life and healthcare practice and what their potential is for enhancing new ways of living into older age. Further, there is limited evidence of their effectiveness to date, and the problems with adoption from the patients perspectives suggest it is timely to reflect on these experiences and reimagine new ways of approaching AAL/telecare from a broader socio-technical perspective. To this end, we propose AAL/telecare as modular infrastructures for the home that can be adapted and repurposed, starting with personal quality of life and social needs (supporting peer care) and progressing to monitoring, physical and medical needs (supporting formal care) as relevant for a person and as needs evolve. This extends the adoption path to supporting healthy ageing, taking notions of agency, adaptivity and social reciprocity as core principles. We illustrate this with some examples and identify some of the associated technical and methodological challenges.",

		"abstract": "Dynamically adaptive systems (DASs) are intended to monitor the execution environment and then dynamically adapt their behavior in response to changing environmental conditions. The uncertainty of the execution environment is a major motivation for dynamic adaptation; it is impossible to know at development time all of the possible combinations of environmental conditions that will be encountered. To date, the work performed in requirements engineering for a DAS includes requirements monitoring and reasoning about the correctness of adaptations, where the DAS requirements are assumed to exist. This paper introduces a goal-based modeling approach to develop the requirements for a DAS, while explicitly factoring uncertainty into the process and resulting requirements. We introduce a variation of threat modeling to identify sources of uncertainty and demonstrate how the RELAX specification language can be used to specify more flexible requirements within a goal model to handle the uncertainty.",

		"abstract": "Everyday more and more ubiquitous applications are developed to support aging in place and ambient assisted living. Although these technologies typically adhere to the functional requirements defined by their developers, many of these solutions evidence limitations for being adopted by end-users, i.e., older adults. This paper reports the authors experience in the design and deployment of several iterations of the SocialConnector system---a computer-supported family communication mediator---as a case study that helps identify key factors that ease the adoption of ambient intelligent systems encouraging intergenerational family communication at home. The particularity of the followed approach is to assemble widely available mass-market technology---such as commercial Tablet PCs and TV displays---glued together with innovative software, as a way to drive system adoption through economically affordable hardware running over empirically-driven considerations for designing effective software in this study domain. The case study results help researchers and practitioners to conceive technology that has a better chance of being embraced by older adults and their supporting family networks; particularly, when such a technology is going to be deployed in their homes. Therefore, the key design factors identified in this paper can be used to inform the conception and modeling of ambient intelligent systems that help older adults address several aspects of their aging in place process, like health monitoring, personal security, social engagement, support to daily activities, and ultimately, fostering wellbeing.",

To reduce the risk of such incidents, security policies are often employed to regulate access to information. Such policies, however, are often too restrictive, and users do not have the rights necessary to perform assigned duties. As a consequence, access control mechanisms are perceived by users as a barrier and thus bypassed, making the system insecure. In this paper, we draw a bridge between the social concept of conviviality and access control. Conviviality has been introduced as a social science concept for ambient intelligence and multi-agent systems to highlight soft qualitative requirements like user-friendliness of systems. To bridge the gap between conviviality and security, we propose a methodological framework for updating and adapting access control policies based on conviviality recommendations. Our methodology integrates and extends existing techniques to assist system designers in the derivation of access control policies from socio-technical requirements of the system, while taking into account the conviviality of the system. We illustrate our framework using the Ambient Assisted Living use case from the HotCity of Luxembourg.",

Nowadays, the ageing population, the high costs for the individual treatment in nursing homes, and the importance that the individuals increasingly necessary to be self-supporting all motivate development of intelligent hardware (i.e. ATs) for safe and independent living. However, AAL related to ambient intelligence (AmIAmI), together with the wide spectrum of ATs, is too heterogeneous and hence difficult to handle. In this context, managing the adaptable embedded software development has become more important, which provides guidance for the organization of a software system including the set of significant decisions, the selection of the structural elements, their relationships to each other, and composition of these elements into progressively larger subsystems, etc. In this chapter, we centre our attention from the perspective of computer science, particularly, we focus on the proposal of software reference architecture (SRASRA) for the development, standardization, and evolution of system architectures of AAL. The main aim of this work tends to justify that how embedded software development can be better managed via the proposed approach. The ultimate goal would be trans-domain applicability of the adaptable embedded software system.",

With this extended editorial, we embark on an exploration journey into the exciting new area of reliable intelligent environments (RIEs). Taking the perspective of an RIE engineer, we present a selection of approaches that have been put forward to design, verify, and operate IEs in a manner so that users can rely on Intelligent Environment systems. We outline crucial challenges: the situatedness which exposes IE to challenges similar to those known from robotics and control systems, the embedding of human users and the safety, privacy, and usability requirements thus entailed, and the amounts of data produced by sensors and actuators, which require advanced reasoning and learning mechanisms to handle them in a reliable way in real-time. We also sketch the opportunities reliable IEs provide to developing new markets and products.",

		"abstract": "Dementia refers to a group of chronic conditions that cause the permanent and gradual cognitive decline. Therefore, a Person with Dementia (PwD) requires constant care from various classes of caregivers. The care costs of PwDs bear a tremendous burden on healthcare systems around the world. It is commonly accepted that utilising smart homes (SH), as an instance of ambient assisted living (AAL) technologies, can facilitate the care, and consequently improve the quality of PwDs well-being. Nevertheless, most of the existing platforms assume dementia care is a straight application of standard SH technology without accommodating the specific requirements of dementia care. A consequence of this approach is the inadequacy and unacceptability of generic SH systems in the context of dementia care. Contrary to most of the existing SH systems proposed for dementia care, this study considers the specific requirements of PwDs and their care circle in all development steps of an SH. In addition, it investigates how utilising novel design and computing approaches can enhance the quality of SHs for dementia care. To do so, the requirements of dementia care stakeholders are collected, analysed and reflected on in an SH system design. Extensions and adaptation of existing frameworks and technologies are proposed to implement a prototype based on the resulting design. Finally, thorough evaluations and validation of the prototype are carried out. The evaluations by a group of stakeholders show the suitability of the proposed methodology and consequently the resulting prototypes for reducing dementia care difficulties as well as its potential for deployment in the real-world environment.",

While the basic prioritization algorithms result in a total or partial order of the requirements, it is often the case that the priority of the requirements depends on the context at hand. This is especially true in ambient intelligence systems such as smart homes, which operate in an inherently dynamic environment that may affect the priority of the requirements at runtime. For example, depending on the health status of a smart home inhabitant, safety may become more important than comfort or cost-saving. In this paper, we make three contributions: (i) we introduce a novel method for the contextual prioritization of requirements, (ii) we propose an online platform for prioritizing the requirements for a smart home based on our method, and (iii) we report on results from an initial evaluation of the platform and the prioritization method.",

A good requirements definition is thus the prerequisite for high-quality solutions and reduces the cost of change, both of prototypes and production tools, and ultimately the warranty costs. However, RE for system development is more and more challenged by two interrelated trends: the increasing complexity of systems and the responsibility of the provider for the whole system life cycle. Thus, from a systems engineering point of view, RE has to define requirements for a rising amount of tangible and intangible components from a growing number of different stakeholders. Additionally, RE has to take into account requirements from every stage of the system life cycle and feed the results back to the development process. Many organizations are still missing effective practices and a documented RE process to tackle the upcoming challenges in systems engineering. This chapter aims at giving an overview on the RE context and challenges for systems engineering and subsequently describes the state-of-the-art for structuring and processing requirements. Furthermore, two case studies illustrate the current situation and methods for resolution in industry and show how the identified challenges can be met by IT support. Finally, future trends and needs for RE research and its further integration with concurrent engineering and life cycle management approaches are outlined.",

		"abstract": "Events are central aspect of many semantic ambient media applications such as surveillance, smart homes, automobiles, and others. Existing models for events typically do not follow a systematic development approach, are conceptually narrow with respect to event features, and their semantics is often ambiguous. This makes the communication between and integration of different event-based components and event-based semantic ambient media applications a challenging task. In this paper, we present the Event-Model-F, a formal model of events based on the foundational ontology DOLCE+DnS Ultralite (DUL). The Event-Model-F provides comprehensive support to represent time and space, objects and persons, mereological, causal, and correlative relationships between events, and different interpretations of the same event. It is developed following a pattern-oriented ontology design approach and can be easily extended by domain specific ontologies. We introduce the design and implementation of an application programming interface that allows for easy integration of the Event-Model-F in arbitrary applications. The use of the Event-Model-F is demonstrated at the example of a socio-technical system of emergency response and implemented in the SemaPlorer+thinspace+ application for creating and sharing event descriptions.",

The review covered 238 journal papers from five digital libraries. The 55 papers that met the review inclusion criteria focused on 22 NFRs, each describing a unique system behavior quality. The most dominant of these NFRs were interoperability,usability, performance,security, privacy, safety, and accuracy. A noticeable NFR gap is the notion of caring. It is not readily apparent how a medical device that monitors a patient or delivers medications or anesthetics can care about the sufferings, feelings and emotional needs of a patient; however, in the healthcare arena these are valid concerns. A second theme found in the papers reviewed focused on software standards/process improvement when developing software intensive medical devices. This research also provides an analysis of the software architecture tactics those researchers utilized to implement the NFRs in the medical devices.",

For instance, informing family members and friends about long periods with no social activity at the older adults home.

Interaction with auto-discovered target devices present in the environment (e.g., the air conditioning of a hotel) is not so easy since devices may provide inaccessible user interfaces (e.g., in a foreign language that the user cannot understand). Scalability for multiple concurrent users and response times are still problems in this domain. In this paper, we assess an interoperable architecture, which enables interaction between people with some kind of special need and their environment. The assessment, based on performance patterns and antipatterns, tries to detect performance issues and also tries to enhance the architecture design for improving system performance. As a result of the assessment, the initial design changed substantially. We refactorized the design according to the Fast Path pattern and The Ramp antipattern. Moreover, resources were correctly allocated. Finally, the required response time was fulfilled in all system scenarios. For a specific scenario, response time was reduced from 60 seconds to less than 6 seconds.",

Standard and dedicated engineering tools for developing such web sites are however yet to be invented. This paper describes our software platform for their development by reuse and extension, while meeting the requirements of end-user accessibility, expressivity, interpretability, web compatibility, shareability and traceability as they appear in person-centric areas like Ambient Assisted Living.

CoDesign is an activity related to the third MCSE development step whose objective is to express the implementation specification of the hardware and software parts of systems. More specifically, the objective includes the definition of the required hardware architecture and the organization of the software on each microprocessor component; this needs hardware/software partitioning and allocation of functions onto hardware components. As solutions for electronic and computer-based systems require hardware and software components, one may think that the overall solution systematically results from following Hw/Sw CoDesign process. In fact, considering entire systems, their software part is increasing. This is why a system-level design process in front of CoDesign is helpful to determine the specific subparts of the system to be developed for which Hw/Sw partitioning is not obvious and not imposed. The MCSE methodology and specifically its third step leads to an answer for this issue rarely raised in todays CoDesign methods.",

In such a setting, privacy has emerged as a key concern as companies often neglect or even misuse personal data. In response to this, governments around the world have enacted laws and regulations for privacy protection. These laws dictate privacy requirements for any system that acquires and manages personal data. Unfortunately, these requirements are often incomplete and/or inaccurate as many RE practitioners might be unsure of what exactly are privacy requirements and how are they different from other requirements, such as security. To tackle this problem, we developed a comprehensive ontology for privacy requirements. To make it comprehensive, we base our ontology on a systematic review of the literature on privacy requirements. The contributions of this work include the derivation of an ontology from a previously conducted systematic literature review, an implementation using an ontology definition tool (Protege), a demonstration of its coverage through an extensive example on Ambient Assisted Living, and a validation through a competence questionnaire answered by lexical semantics experts as well as privacy and security researchers.",

Self-adaptation is particularly necessary for applications that must run continuously, even under adverse conditions and changing requirements; sample domains include automotive systems, telecommunications, and environmental monitoring systems. While a few techniques have been developed to support the monitoring and analysis of requirements for adaptive systems, limited attention has been paid to the actual creation and specification of requirements of self-adaptive systems. As a result, self-adaptivity is often constructed in an ad-hoc manner. In order to support the rigorous specification of adaptive systems requirements, this paper introduces RELAX, a new requirements language for self-adaptive systems that explicitly addresses uncertainty inherent in adaptive systems. We present the formal semantics for RELAX in terms of fuzzy logic, thus enabling a rigorous treatment of requirements that include uncertainty. RELAX enables developers to identify uncertainty in the requirements, thereby facilitating the design of systems that are, by definition, more flexible and amenable to adaptation in a systematic fashion. We illustrate the use of RELAX on smart home applications, including an adaptive assisted living system.",

To tackle this issue, Ambient Assistive Living (AAL) systems can reinforce the well-being of elderly people, by providing emergency, autonomy enhancement, and comfort services. These services will postpone the need of a medicalized environment and will allow the elderly to stay longer at home. However, each elderly has specific needs and a deployment environment of such services is likely unique. Furthermore, the needs evolve over time, and so does the deployment environment of the system. In this paper, we propose the use of a model-based development method, the adaptive medium approach, to enable dynamic adaptation of AAL systems. We also propose improvements to make it more suited to the AAL domain, such as considering heterogeneity and a composition model. The paper includes an evaluation of the prototype implementing the approach, and a comparison with related work.",

We reviewed 49 of 389 papers found that were directly related to our goal. The results show that most of the proposals for dealing with requirements (78%) use already defined methods or techniques, and that 67% of these techniques are based on the goal-oriented paradigm. A total of 96% of the reviewed papers focus on techniques for analyzing requirements and only 39% of them explicitly consider some kind of elicitation technique.

But the development of mobile applications for autonomy support is a challenging activity. Some of the challenges are the diversity of target platforms (including display sizes, keypads or tactile screens variations in each platform), and the limits in memory size, processing resources, battery duration, etc. For these reasons, a software product line (SPL) approach can provide a considerable advantage in mobile application development. This article presents a SPL that makes possible the remote monitoring of dependent people to facilitate their autonomy. Wireless sensors allow real-time information such as heart rate or oxygen saturation level to be controlled. Risk situations, including fall detection, critical in elderly persons who live alone, can also be detected. In the SPL approach, only the required features are incorporated in each concrete product (avoiding the device overload with a resource-costly extensive solution). The article presents an Android/Symbian based SPL architecture, using Bluetooth wireless sensors connected to a Smartphone. The mobile system is able to detect alarm situations and is remotely connected to a central system, aimed for its use in elderly residences.",

This set takes into account the complexity of smart environment systems that are comprised of multiple subsystems and applied in non-static environments. We show how the model can be used to find a suitable sensor for a use case and the inverse option to find suitable use cases for a given set of sensors. Additionally, extensions are presented that normalize differently rated systems and compensate for central tendency bias.

The need for increased response rate, problem limited storage, accelerated processing and etc. the tendency toward creating a new generation of healthcare system architecture highlight the need for further focus on cloud-based solutions for transfer data and data processing challenges. Integrity and reliability of healthcare systems are of critical importance, as even the slightest error may put the patients lives in danger; therefore acquiring a behavioral model for these systems and developing the tools required to model their behaviors are of significant importance. The high-level designs may contain some flaws, therefor the system must be fully examined for different scenarios and conditions.

Their major objective is to enable the environment to provide ease and comfort to the users. The reliance on these systems demands consistent behavior. The versatility of devices, user behavior and intricacy of communication complicate the modeling and verification of SmEs reliable behavior. Of the many available modeling and verification techniques, formal methods appear to be the most promising. Due to a large variety of implementation scenarios and support for conditional behavior/processing, the concept of SmE is applicable to diverse areas which calls for focused research. As a result, a number of modeling and verification techniques have been made available for designers. This paper explores and puts into perspective the modeling and verification techniques based on an extended literature survey. These techniques mainly focus on some specific aspects, with a few overlapping scenarios (such as user interaction, devices interaction and control, context awareness, etc.), which were of the interest to the researchers based on their specialized competencies. The techniques are categorized on the basis of various factors and formalisms considered for the modeling and verification and later analyzed. The results show that no surveyed technique maintains a holistic perspective; each technique is used for the modeling and verification of specific SmE aspects. The results further help the designers select appropriate modeling and verification techniques under given requirements and stress for more R&D effort into SmE modeling and verification research.",

This understanding is based on Service-Dominant Logic (S-D Logic), a recognized perspective on value creation in modern economies. Goal-oriented modeling, in particular when integrating agent-oriented principles, has been shown to be a suitable method for designing and developing service systems based on S-D Logic principles. Yet, the impact of S-D Logic on the nature and scope of requirements to be elicited and analyzed when designing a service system using goal-oriented modeling has not been clearly articulated. We propose a domain-specific profile of the Goal-oriented Requirement Language, a goal-oriented modeling language part of the User Requirements Notation standard, as well as a set of heuristics for eliciting requirements for service systems. Both are derived from a metamodel of service systems based on S-D Logic principles. Using a case study of a telemonitoring service, we demonstrate that using the heuristics to generate a requirements model for the design of the service results in a more complete set of requirements than existing solutions for telemonitoring services. The results of this study contribute to a better understanding of the impact of S-D Logic on service engineering, pointing toward the need for more research on the impact of operationalized domain theories on requirements engineering.",

This includes providing new opportunities to people with special needs, such as people with disabilities. In this paper we discuss our approach at designing and developing a smart platform that can assist people with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities (PIMD) in achieving a portion of independence. We apply this approach in the INSENSION project executed within the Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme of the European Commission. In this paper, we describe the characteristics of the disability in question, focusing on the main challenge, which is the inability of individuals with PIMD to use symbols in their interaction. Due to the fact that, to our best knowledge, the topic of constructing a system that could assist this interaction has not been undertaken so far, we were required to thoroughly analyze how individuals with PIMD interact using non-symbolic behaviors. We then defined requirements for the platform capable of supporting their interaction with other people and possibly living environment, designed the architecture and built the first version with the use of AI methods. The evaluation of this version confirmed the soundness of our approach, which enables us to continue our work towards successful implementation of the planned ambient intelligence system and its validation in real-life scenarios.",

		"abstract": "Privacy has emerged as a key concern for business and social computing as security breaches have compromised personal data for millions. Despite this, much of existing work on privacy requirements deal with them as a special case of security requirements, thereby missing essential traits of such requirements. In this context, wrong design decisions may be made due to an insufficient understanding of privacy. The main contribution of this paper is an ontology for privacy requirements that subsumes whatever proposals exist in the literature. The ontology was obtained through a systematic literature review concerning the literature on privacy, conducted in two phases, and followed by a consolidation phase where similar concepts were combined. The proposed ontology has been developed to be used by software engineers when dealing with privacy requirements, and since it is based on a systematic literature review, it is more comprehensive in coverage than all ontologies included in our systematic review. This constitutes a preliminary validity check for the comprehensiveness of our proposal, which needs to be complemented in the future with empirical validation through controlled studies.",

Result of a stroke can be death, or a variety of disabilities caused by impairments in different brain functions. This chapter discusses technology enhanced stroke rehabilitation from a three-fold view of cognitive, motoric and speech rehabilitation. The important research question was: What would be the requirements for technology-enhanced stroke rehabilitation in the areas of cognitive, motoric and speech rehabilitation? The study was carried out with a requirement-focused Design Science approach collecting data with semi-structured interviews. Informants were selected in a purposive sampling choosing professionals with valuable knowledge and skills in stroke rehabilitation. The findings in this study have generated useful general requirements for a future implementation and testing of technology enhanced stroke rehabilitation. Within each of the three rehabilitation categories cognitive, motoric and speech, there seems to be potential for successful use of technology enhanced services. This development of rehabilitation services must follow the fundamental principle for all forms of stroke rehabilitation: each patient needs a personalised treatment. However, in all three rehabilitation categories, there is a need to define more specific requirements based on feedback from stroke patients testing the rehabilitation services.",

Moreover, the introduced architecture allows for intelligent discovery and management of resources.

We also outline a rich set of practical prototype pervasive services that have been built, based on this architecture.

Patterns are leveraged to represent the relationship between security, privacy, dependability and interoperability (SPDI) properties of specific smart objects and corresponding properties of orchestrations that include said objects. In this way, patterns allow the verification that certain SPDI properties hold for an IoT orchestration, while also enabling the adaptation of IoT orchestrations in ways that allow the given properties to hold.",

In this contribution, we present an approach that was developed at Delft University of Technology for addressing ethical issues in R&D. The approach takes the engineers and scientists involved in R&D as entry point for discerning and discussing ethical issues and is to be carried out parallel to the R&D trajectory. On the basis of two cases studies, the network approach is described in detail including its strengths and weaknesses. Two procedural norms for assessing an R&D network are discussed, viz. inclusiveness and second-order learning. Some of the main advantages of the approach are that it offers the possibility to identify moral issues in situations of uncertainty and indeterminacy about the final consequences of technological innovations, while being applied already at the early stages of technological development. Because the moral issues are identified in their real-world context, the approach can generate insights that immediately influence R&D and design decisions. As such, the approach may help focusing the technical work in a way that moral issues are better addressed.",

In this paper, we outline an ICT-enabled novel infrastructure that significantly facilitates user access to a large set of specialised assistive services and enables small ICT players (e.g. web entrepreneurs) to develop novel services on user/user group demand supported by crowd funding. Our vision is to create an infrastructure that can move ideas more quickly from conception to market and consumer availability, that can be more efficient by being better targeted to user needs, that can move users closer to researchers and developers to ensure that the full range of needs are better addressed and that can reduce both the development and operation cost of assistive services. The system we propose consists of the Assistance on Demand (AoD) service infrastructure which aims to be a gateway for accessing on demand diverse types of human and machine-based assistive services. This AoD is accompanied by a flexible payment infrastructure that aims at enabling, for all relevant stakeholders (end users, service providers, etc.), the easy, flexible and reliable handling of multiple bills for different services, while at the same time supporting crowd-funding, as necessary, for user-driven assistive technology (AT) or service development. In this paper, we present the state-of-the-art technologies and approaches that will serve as the basis for the design and development of the AoD and payment infrastructures and then we discuss the requirements that these intertwined systems have to fulfill and draw high-level design directions.",

The downside is that most approaches are not necessarily compatible let alone coordinated. Further, none of the technologies is really integrated into legacy systems or corresponding organizational structures and processes, thus the full power of innovative applications is not utilized. Introducing the concept of smart objects inspired by the Internet of Things can improve the situation by separating the capabilities and functions of an object from the implementing technology such as RFID or WLAN. Wireless tags become interchangeable, and business applications can be built independent from the underlying communication network. Supported by synchronized technological and business developments smart objects have the power to transform a hospital from an agglomeration of technologies into a smart environment.",

		"abstract": "Despite their crucial goal of assisting the elderly through their daily routine, Independent Living Support systems still are at their inception. This paper postulates that such systems be designed with a number of requirements in mind, and in particular with safety, security and privacy as fundamental ones. It then correspondingly articulates the three main challenges behind the development of Independent Living Support systems: requirement elicitation, design and correctness analysis. It is found that requirement elicitation will have to cope with a large variety of issues; that design will have to proceed from modularity; and, notably, that correctness analysis will have to be socio-technical. The last finding in particular emphasises that, for a system that prescribes vast interaction with the human, system correctness only makes sense if the system is analysed in combination with the human, rather than in isolation from the human. Building upon previous experience with the socio-technical analysis of Internet browsers, this paper identifies the specific socio-technical challenges that Independent Living Support systems pose, and indicates an approach to succeed in taking them.",

The service has the following characteristics: one-day system autonomy; self-adjusting interfaces for simple interaction with patients, based on behavioural patterns to predict routes and destinations and to detect lost situations; easy browsing through simple spoken commands and use of photographs for reorientation, and independence of GISs (Geographic Information Systems) to reduce costs and increase accessibility. Initial testing results of the destination prediction algorithm are very positive. This system is integrated in a global e-health/e-care home service architecture platform (OSGi) that enables remote management of services and devices and seamless integration with other home service domains.",

		"abstract": "More and more devices are being interconnected, thus extending the use of Internet of Things (IoT) systems. However, the larger the networks are the more vulnerable and inscrutable they become. This is a significant challenge especially when IoT is used in safety- and security-critical areas. In these areas, a flawless architecture must be guaranteed already in the design phase. Therefore, a structured possibility is needed to scan models completely for vulnerabilities as early as possible. We developed a pattern recognition framework (PRF) that enables the definition of design patterns and anti-patterns. These patterns are used for a holistic and automated identification of flaws in IoT models during design phase and enable a design optimization.",

The amount of linked data has brought with it a number of specialized databases that are capable of storing and processing RDF data, called RDF stores. We explore the RDF store landscape with the aim of finding an RDF store that sufficiently meets the storage needs of an enhanced living environment, more concretely the requirements of a Smart Space platform aimed at running on a cluster set up of low-power hardware that can be run locally entirely at home with the purpose of logging data for a reactive assistive system involving, e.g., activity recognition or domotics. We present a literature analysis of RDF stores and identify promising candidates for implementation of consumer Smart Spaces. Based on the insights provided with our study, we conclude by suggesting different relevant aspects of RDF storage systems that need to be considered in Ambient Assisted Living environments and a comparison of available solutions.",

The system of cameras detects the presence of people and univocally identifies them. Through the depth frames, the system detects the interactions of the shoppers with the products on the shelf and determines if a product is picked up or if the product is taken and then put back and finally, if there is not contact with the products. The system is low cost and easy to install, and experimental results demonstrated that its performances are satisfactory also in real environments.",

		"abstract": "Like other contemporary safety standards EN-50128 requires to identify potential functional and non-functional hazards and to demonstrate that the software does not violate the relevant safety goals. Examples of safety-relevant non-functional hazards are violations of resource bounds, especially stack overflows and deadline violations, as well as run-time errors and data races. They can cause erroneous and erratic program behavior, invalidate separation mechanisms in mixed-criticality software, and even trigger software crashes. Classical software verification methods like code review and testing with measurements cannot really guarantee the absence of errors. Abstract interpretation is a formal method for static program analysis which supports formal soundness proofs (it can be proven that no error is missed) and which scales. This article gives an overview of abstract interpretation and its application to compute safe worst-case execution time and stack bounds, and to find all potential run-time errors, and data races. We discuss the tool qualification of abstract interpretation-based static analyzers and describe their contribution with respect to EN-50128 compliant verification processes. We also illustrate their integration in the development process and report on practical experience.",

In this paper, we propose an approach to analyze a hierarchical structured model to determine critical goals. Afterwards, the effects and impacts of failures are calculated and determined to identify components which have a need of counter measures. Furthermore, it is analyzed which kind of effects these counter measures will have within the hierarchical model.

A comprehensive requirements analysis has been carried out with its findings being compared with existing assurance frameworks such as NIST 800-63-3, IGTF and Kantara. Due to the special requirements in a federated environment that spans multiple countries, none of the existing frameworks seems to scale in this environment. In this context, conditions such as the independence of organizations, the different organizational cultures and technical capabilities prevent the definition of strict security requirements as they are required in most policies. The REFEDS assurance suite presented here, defines a set of identity and authentication assurance criteria also including two assurance profiles differentiating between low-risk and high-risk research use cases. The presented approach still incorporates relevant criteria from existing frameworks and has been evaluated by means of a public consultation and a technical pilot. The evaluation has shown successful configuration and testing with Shibboleth and SimpleSAMLphp software, but also positive feedback from the R&E community members.",

In this paper, we describe MoCoA, a flexible middleware framework that permits the rapid development of context-aware applications and supports deployment scenarios ranging from augmented artefacts to city-wide smart-space applications. Crucially, MoCoA supports a small set of programming abstractions that are suitable for building a wide range of context-aware applications for deployment in a fixed or (ad hoc) mobile environment. For each of these abstractions, MoCoA provides a set of implementations via a library of components. We present three applications of the MoCoA framework that demonstrate both the use of the programming abstractions and the flexibility of the framework.",

Almost real-time information regarding the emerging trends can be gained through efficient techniques/algorithms to examine this enormous amount of data, which also gives hint about early warning if there is an imminent emergency case. Also, numerous helpful indicators regarding political and socioeconomic events can be seen through by carefully mining these data, which also aid in establishing efficient public policies. However, web services and data security---protection of systems and key data to avoid unauthorised tampering---is considered to be a non-trivial real-time issue. Moreover, security issue has always been a grave issue since there is frequent conflict of service availability with the security constraints should there be a change in the service media channels. The papers primary focus is on new mathematical models that help in simplifying and enhancing protection for multimedia big content against unauthorised tampering by examining elements of multimedia objects. Furthermore, a multimedia big data security framework is presented in this paper. This framework, built on the basis of the proposed models, will be employed to confirm the on-fly multimedia content for a requested service/page.

This makes the available homecare services hardly interoperable at the process level, particularly due to the lack of support for process flexibility.

IoT also assumes to deal with a huge amount of heterogeneous data generated by devices, transmitted by the underpinning infrastructure and processed to support value-added services. In order to provide users with valuable output, the IoT architecture should guarantee the suitability and trustworthiness of the processed data. This is a major requirement of such systems in order to guarantee robustness and reliability at the service level. In this paper, we introduce a novel IoT architecture able to support security, privacy and data quality guarantees, thereby effectively boosting the diffusion of IoT services.",

		"abstract": "The expectations of the abilities of context-aware systems (C-AS) often differ from reality. It becomes difficult to program contextual services that react adequately to the circumstantial needs of users as developers need to know, beforehand: the set of contextual states that may exist, what information could accurately determine a contextual state within that set, and what appropriate action should be taken in that particular state. Although there exist many frameworks and tools which support the design and implementation of C-AS, there is less conceptual help for developers to inform them of what contextual situations and services are appropriate (or feasible) to be implemented. This report reviews the state-of-the-art conceptualisation of context, which is more focused on the representational interpretation of the concept, to introduce a perspective that also acknowledges its interactional interpretation. A combination of revised and new definitions is introduced, which give key insights for the development of more useful C-AS. By acknowledging situations as a dynamic phenomenon that arises from action (interaction), and needs to be understood by the developers, it facilitates the analysis of these subjective interpretations into programming constructs (representation). The conceptualisation is also complemented with a set of guidelines for developers, an illustration of their usage, and a further discussion on the future directions for the engineering of more usable C-AS. The introduced conceptualisation is targeted towards the creation of an open-source tool supported framework for the engineering of C-AS.",

Examples can be found in domains, such as smart cities, crisis and emergency, IoT, big data, industry 4.0, and connected health systems. Most of them can be considered systems-of-systems (SoS), since they refer to alliances of operational and managerial independent software-intensive systems, which are sometimes distributed over different environments. Therefore, SoS software architectures must be dynamic, evolve over time, and support the execution of emergent behaviors to accomplish SoS missions. They must be also designed to enable the connection of heterogeneous systems, making possible their interoperation, communication, coordination, cooperation, and collaboration, most of the times, in a seamless way. Similar challenges have been addressed by using software mediators as architectural entities. However, the application of mediators in SoS has not been properly explored.",

		"abstract": "Developments in technology have shifted the focus of medical practice from treating a disease to prevention. Currently, a significant enhancement in healthcare is expected to be achieved through the Internet of Things (IoT). There are various wearable IoT devices that track physiological signs and signals in the market already. These devices usually connect to the Internet directly or through a local smart phone or a gateway. Home-based and in hospital patients can be continuously monitored with wearable and implantable sensors and actuators. In most cases, these sensors and actuators are resource constrained to perform computing and operate for longer periods. The use of traditional gateways to connect to the Internet provides only connectivity and limited network services. With the introduction of the Fog computing layer, closer to the sensor network, data analytics and adaptive services can be realized in remote healthcare monitoring. This chapter focuses on a smart e-health gateway implementation for use in the Fog computing layer, connecting a network of such gateways, both in home and in hospital use. To show the application of the services, simple healthcare scenarios are presented. The features of the gateway in our Fog implementation are discussed and evaluated.",

		"abstract": "Providing IT-based care support for elderly at home is proposed as a highly promising appraoch to address the aging population problem. With the emergence of homecare application service providers, a homecare system can be seen as a linked set of services. Configuring and composing existing homecare application services to create new homecare composite applications can reduce the application development cost. The idea even looks more promising if the service provisioning is dynamic, i.e., if applications can update their behaviors with respect to the contextual changes without or with minimum manpower. Dynamic service provisioning can play an important role to accept homecare systems in practical settings. This motivated us to develop a Dynamic Homecare Service Provisioning (DHSP) platform to address the homecare context changes in an effective and efficient manner. As a proof of concept, we have developed a software prototype of our platform. The prototype was subsequently used in a real-world field test at a care institution in the Netherlands to validate the approach. This paper describes the design of the field test and reflects on the outcome of the validation experiments.",

In this chapter, we build upon the outcomes of a systematic review of secondary studies in software engineering, which has identified (a) the most common threats to validity and corresponding mitigation actions and (b) the categories in which threats to validity can be classified, so as to guide the authors of future secondary studies in managing the threats to validity of their work. To achieve this goal, we describe (a) a classification schema for reporting threats to validity and possible mitigation actions and (b) a checklist, which authors of secondary studies can use for identifying and categorizing threats to validity and corresponding mitigation actions, while readers of secondary studies can use the checklist for assessing the validity of the reported results.",

		"abstract": "A major issue in designing digital healthcare software solutions is ensuring they meet the clinical needs and requirements of key services, as well as the expectations of various healthcare professionals. Modern software requirements engineering must be adapted to cater for this demand; we argue that traditional (and popular) requirements engineering processes -- particularly in relation to the elicitation and validation of key requirements -- may not be the most appropriate within the context of a multi-disciplinary team of healthcare professionals. Successful software requirements engineering is vital in ensuring that digital healthcare solutions fulfill expectations and meet the clinical needs; we thus propose that new methods of gathering requirements in the third space are needed. This paper draws on a case study of the multi-disciplinary team of healthcare professionals involved in the diagnosis and support of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in young children within the UKs National Health Service (NHS). It is worth noting that, in the context of our case study, requirements engineering is an iterative process and requires the input of numerous stakeholders from often stretched and fragmented services.",

These platforms are prepared to parse and check source code written in a variety of general-purpose programming languages. The emergence of domain-specific languages enables professionals from different areas to develop and describe problem solutions in their disciplines. Thus, source code quality analysis methods and tools can also be applied to software artefacts developed with a domain-specific language. To evaluate the quality of domain-specific language code, every software component required by the quality platform to parse and query the source code must be developed. This becomes a time-consuming and error-prone task, for which this paper describes a model-driven interoperability strategy that bridges the gap between the grammar formats of source code quality parsers and domain-specific text languages. This approach has been tested on the most widespread platforms for designing text-based languages and source code analysis. This interoperability approach has been evaluated on a number of specific contexts in different domain areas.",

This can be used for non-verbal communication, enabling the deaf to communicate without the need for sign language translation and with a richer context than just using text. This paper explores the development process of iconographic driven applications for nonverbal communication following a user centered design approach. MyCarMobile, a mobile application intended to facilitate the communication of the deaf with roadside assistance services, is introduced as a case study. The application follows the iconographic driven interaction model allowing users to describe an occurrence, through the interaction with icons and buttons in a touchscreen device. Based on the implementation of the case study application and previous work a set of guidelines for implementing iconographic driven applications is proposed.",

To cope with unexpected delays, patient coordinators often pursue a worst case scenario when scheduling patient assessments, leading to an underutilization of human resources and equipment when the procedure went without complications. We present a context-based decision support system for patient planning that helps the patient coordinator with taking well-informed rescheduling decisions and anticipating changes in other patients schedules. The system uses information and events produced by medical equipment. As these events can be non-deterministic, we demonstrate how our domain specific context model can be used to contextualize events to enhance their quality and ascertain their meaning.",

		"abstract": "In order to become more innovative, companies that operate in the Smart Living domain increasingly initiate and participate in networked business environments that transcend industry boundaries. Inter-organizational collaboration is often characterized by conflicting strategic interests and incoherent operational business processes and procedures. Although many scholars and practitioners use stakeholder analysis to gain insight into the actors relationships and interactions, existing literature on stakeholder analysis focuses mainly on high-level strategic analysis, often limited to a conceptual and static understanding of stakeholder interests. In this paper, it is argued that a true understanding of stakeholders can be achieved by looking at their interactions and interdependencies at a more detailed level. This study uses a conceptual framework from the service innovation and business model domain, the VIP framework, to extend stakeholder analysis by including an analysis of their dynamic interactions and processes. The qualitative evaluation of the frameworks application in illustrative design cases shows that this extension provides additional insights into stakeholders, and their potential operational conflicts and critical dependencies. By making these conflicts and interdependencies explicit, products and services are potentially easier to implement and commercialize.",

They are especially relevant for mobile and pervasive computing environments, in which user attention is at a premium. To support the development of context-aware applications, techniques for modelling context information are required. These must address a unique combination of requirements, including the ability to model information supplied by both sensors and people, to represent imperfect information, and to capture context histories. As the field of context-aware computing is relatively new, mature solutions for context modelling do not exist, and researchers rely on information modelling solutions developed for other purposes. In our research, we have been using a variant of Object-Role Modeling (ORM) to model context. In this paper, we reflect on our experiences and outline some research challenges in this area.",

It is one of the problems that the European health system, and in particular the Spanish system, has to face out. This increase is linked to the rising of dependent people, whose suffer progressive deterioration of both their physical and mental capacities. In this context, technology plays a key role in improving the quality of life, not only of older people but also their caregivers. A technological ecosystem to support patients with mental illness, their caregivers, and the connection with their relatives was developed in previous works. This solution is prepared to evolve according to the users and organizations needs. In this sense, the present work describes the inclusion of a new software tool, an online sales platform that promotes active ageing, seeking that it can be used and managed by older people who may have cognitive impairment problems. Although there are many e-commerce platforms on the market, they not consider users with special needs. The objective has not been to develop a software prototype from scratch, but to focus on aspects relating to accessibility and usability to improve online stores and apply these improvements to an existing solution, following the philosophy of Open Source software development. This work aims to describe the definition process itself.",

In this context, telemedical services for communication between doctors and patients come into fore. However, it is unclear in how far users accept these new care concepts. Crucial for the success of telemedical services is the choice of the medium and its perceived appropriateness in different using situations. In this paper, an exploratory approach was undertaken to examine the users acceptance of four electronic communication media (telephone, videophone, videoconference, interactive wall) in three different usage situations (additional service, urgency situation, exclusively telemedical consultation). 200 participants volunteered to take part. Findings show that the acceptance strongly depends on the specific situation and the type of communication media. User diversity, in contrast, did not show a major role for the acceptance of telemedical consultation.",

In particular, two key classes of approaches exist, based on FIPA interaction protocols and tuple spaces. The contribution of this paper is the comparison and evaluation of tuple spaces and FIPA-compliant coordination mechanisms for the development of pervasive applications.

This paper we proposed a service-oriented contextual architecture for creating fast contextual services. The objective of this study is to develop an intelligent agent platform that applies the developed intelligent agent platform to the field of medical applications.

In special education, wrist-worn wearables have potential to support students in their everyday learning activities. The concrete opportunities in this domain are still unclear though. To explore the potential of wrist-worn applications in special education, we employ user-centered design techniques to elicit the application needs and system requirements. Then, we formally specified, developed and tested an assistive application. The Wearable Life app is a cross-platform solution that integrates a mobile and a wearable device to assist students with intellectual and developmental disabilities and as such enhance their educational experience.",

Following this trend and based on our experience, the future will witness the joint use of these techniques to design applications able to improve quality and comfort of peoples daily life.

Measurement experiments using emulated workloads were carried out for increasing loads, and the effects on capacity of encoding-mode and user interactions were explored.

The extent to which this is possible strongly depends on careful design and accessible, easy-to-use products, developed using an older adults centred methodology. This paper follows this design approach and puts it to the test in developing Medication Assistant, an application aimed to contribute to lower the high levels of non-adherence to medication in the ageing population. This application is developed following an iterative method centred on the older adults and interaction design. The method repeats short development cycles encompassing the definition of scenarios and goals, requirements engineering, design, prototyping and evaluation by the target users. The evaluation of the increasingly refined prototypes is of paramount importance in this methodology, gathering information about the strengths and weaknesses of the application. These, along with user suggestions, constitute an important starting point to support further improvements in the subsequent development cycle. The first three development cycles for Medication Assistant are presented, highlighting the main aspects of each stage, and how the evaluation performed, at the end of each cycle, provided feedback to further refine the application with new and improved features. At its current stage, Medication Assistant obtained very positive evaluation outcomes and already provides a set of useful features concerning medication management. These features go beyond the typical medication reminders and aim to provide a first contribution towards a more holistic approach to medication non-adherence.",

		"abstract": "Software architecture design, when performed in context of agile software development (ASD), sometimes referred as agile architecting, promotes the emerging and incremental design of the architectural artifact, in a sense of avoiding big design upfront (BDUF). Performing agile architecting is not always straightforward, mainly because the architecture has a required life-cycle and each stage responds to different needs. There is a lack of a pathway that guides agile architecting in an end-to-end approach (from business requirements to deployment). This paper proposes a pathway that includes architecture design from software development life-cycle (SDLC) stages of software development that use ASD approaches, where two main artifacts are considered: a candidate logical architecture and a refined logical architecture. These artifacts are included in a pathway where they receive input from business processes perspective and guide software development during ASD iterations (Sprints).",

The generic objective of the Environmentally Sensitive Investment System (ESIS) Project is to provide industry and governmental departments or agencies with a tool to assess the technical and economic implications of capital-intensive projects, in response to stated environmental policies. More specifically, the ESIS prototype helps to find wastewater management alternatives that meet given environmental regulatory standards in a technologically sound and cost-efficient manner. The use of this decision support system will enhance the ability of managers and planners to explore the quantitative implications of a wide range of options. ESIS incorporates a combination of artificial intelligence and operations research techniques, database management and visualization tools, integrated under a graphical user interface. The ESIS prototype runs on top-of-the-line personal computers.",

The IoT paradigm enables low-resource devices to intercommunicate in a fully flexible and pervasive manner, and the data from these devices is used for decision-making in critical applications such as; traffic infrastructure, health-care and home security, to name but a few. Due to the scarce resources available in these IoT devices, being able to quantify the reliability of them is a critical function. This report presents a detailed evolution of the area of reliability measurement, followed by an in-depth review of the state-of-the-art for quantification of reliability in the IoT, revealing the many challenges associated with this task. From this in-depth review, a set of key research directions for IoT reliability is determined.

Thus, this study analyzes the ways academic and industrial communities have developed tools for building inclusive environments. The main findings of this review are: (1) an urgent need for the recognition of accessibility as an important non-functional requirement; (2) a need for taking into account the social conditions of users, such as illiteracy and people living in underserved communities; and (3) the identification of new research questions in the context of multi-device inclusive environments.",

Therefore, we advocate the use of autonomic systems to do this work automatically. Thus, in this paper, we propose and evaluate Dohko, an autonomic and goal-oriented system for inter-cloud environments. Dohko implements self-configuration, self-healing, and context-awareness properties. Likewise, it relies on a hierarchical P2P overlay (a) to manage theÂ  virtual machines running on the clouds and (b) to deal with inter-cloud communication. Furthermore, it depends on a software product line engineering method to enable applications deployment and reconfiguration, without requiring pre-configured virtual machine images. Experimental results show that Dohko can free the users from the duty of executing non-native cloud application on single and over many clouds. In particular, it tackles the lack of middleware prototypes that can support different scenarios when using simultaneous services from multiple clouds.",

In particular, we describe the layered framework, methodologies, and application features such as continence management, agitation rating, medication management, sleep activity monitoring, telephysiotherapy and respiratory monitoring to illustrate the possibilities offered by iCOPE. A novel service oriented intervention and just-in-time therapy mechanism using uPnP which can handle both synchronous and asynchronous events is also presented. iCOPE can promote independent living and improve quality of life for elderly persons living alone, and can provide caregivers and family members with peace of mind as they know that there are systems in place to monitor their loved ones. In an institutional or nursing home setting, iCOPE can provide valuable backup since it operates round the clock and has the potential to identify anomalous behavior that might otherwise be missed which in turn can improve the quality of care for patients. It is hoped that iCOPE will extend the capabilities of monitoring to various settings, thereby encouraging the clinicians and caregivers to examine new interventions and therapy that might improve the patients overall condition.",

Typically these are long-lived systems in which dynamic co-evolution, whereby a system evolves as part of its own execution in reaction to both predicted and emergent events, is the only feasible option for change.

Evaluation of these systems is a critical and challenging issue but seldom tackled. It is important before evaluating a system to figure out what is the evaluation goal. In our case, such a goal is to evaluate enhanced user experience and beyond the evaluation goal it is also a central concern about what to evaluate. In this paper we propose a multi-agent home care system where we describe how agents coordinate their decisions to provide e-services to patients when at home after hospitalization. Finally we center our proposal on the adaptation of an evaluation system, previously developed, to support the challenges of an e-Health environment and also the multi-user evaluation. These evaluation methods (online/offline) will provide users (patients, patients relatives and healthcare professionals) feedback into the system.",

		"abstract": "Traditionally, there has been much attention on workplace studies and design for work within the HCI (Human Computer Interaction) and CSCW (Computer Supported Cooperative Work) communities. Those communities have recently shown an increasing interest in healthcare and especially non-professional care settings such as patients private homes. When healthcare is moved from clinical settings to private homes, more attention is put on the care receiver, his/her everyday life and private home. In contrast with the hospital, the home however is not designed as a place for care. Moving healthcare activities, including treatment of severe diseases to private homes and other non-clinical settings (e.g. the patients workplace or vacation resorts) not prepared for these care activities may have severe consequences. In fact, the relocation of care may challenge, on different levels, the patients, their caregivers and society at large. This chapter presents and discusses seven challenges that the authors argue are important to consider when designing for holistic and sustainable home-based healthcare. Examples of these challenges are: Societal concerns, Complexity of care providers, Heterogeneity of care providers and Installation and maintenance. These challenges include law and legislation related aspects, environmental issues and the feasibility of large-scale deployment of home-care designs. The challenges discussed in this chapter have not been satisfactorily taken into account by the existing homecare designs and HCI research. Our chapter suggests that designers and HCI practitioners must be aware of, and reflect upon how these challenges can affect the value, feasibility and a wider implementation of their homecare designs.",

This paper summarizes a program of investigations currently underway in this laboratory to characterize the geometry of fractured rocks and develop methods of handling flow in such systems. Numerical models have been developed to investigate flow behavior in two- and three-dimensional fracture networks. The results demonstrate the insights that can be gained from modeling studies of fractured rocks. A key problem is gathering the necessary data on fracture geometry. Investigations have been started to determine how vertical seismic profiling (VSP) might be improved and applied to this problem. A VSP experiment in The Geysers geothermal field in northern California, where fracture orientation is known, produced shear wave splitting and velocity anisotropy in agreement with theory. The results suggest the potential application of 3-component, multi-source VSP data in determining fracture orientation and average spacing. We believe a combination of seismic and hydraulic methods can greatly enhance an understanding of fluid flow and transport in low permeability rock systems where fractures provide the dominant paths.",

		"abstract": "This article presents a comparative review of systems performing service composition in Ambient Intelligence Environments. Such environments should comply to ubiquitous or pervasive computing guidelines by sensing the user needs or wishes and offering intuitive human-computer interaction and a comfortable non-intrusive experience. To achieve this goal service orientation is widely used and tightly linked with AmI systems. Some of these employ the Web Service technology, which involves well-defined web technologies and standards that facilitate interoperable machine to machine interaction. Other systems regard services of different technologies (e.g. UPnP, OSGi etc) or generally as abstractions of various actions. Service operations are sometimes implemented as software based functions or actions over hardware equipment (e.g. UPnP players). However, a single service satisfies an atomic only user need, so services need to be composed (i.e. combined), in order to provide the usually requested complex tasks. Since manual service composition is obviously a hassle for the user, ambient systems struggle to automate this process by applying various methods. The approaches that have been adopted during the last years vary widely in many aspects, like domain of application, modeling of services, composition method, knowledge representation and interfaces. This work presents a comparative view of these approaches revealing similarities and differences, while providing additional information.",

However, a specific focus on QoL of frail older persons or older persons with permanent need of external help is rare, and even more neglected is the role of care for their QoL. In addition, the question of how much the existing definitions really reflect the opinions of older people themselves has got too little attention (Bowling, Gabriel, Banister, & Sutton, 2002). These notions motivated the Care Keys research to search for a better understanding of the role of homecare and institutional care for the QoL of frail older persons. Applying the production of welfare approach (see Chapter 1), the aim was to produce information on the specific life situations of these older persons, and on the linkages between care and QoL. By providing a model of care-related QoL we aimed at a concept that would allow for the evaluation of care practices in view of their outcomes for frail older persons, thus supporting development of care practices as well as quality management of (long-term) care.",

In the smart industry, there are many types of devices connected to the Internet of Things, and the data format of the devices is not uniform. Therefore, when the upper layer application collects device data and manages the devices, it is necessary to introduce middleware to solve these problems. A service-oriented IoT middleware model is designed. This middleware is built on the background of the smart campus with the above characteristics. The middleware is responsible for realizing the information interaction between the front-end sensing device and the upper-layer application, sending the commands of the upper-layer application to the device to implement real-time management of the device and providing a heterogeneous intelligent device for accessing the Internet of Things application environment, an effective solution. And through an application example, the working principle and implementation of this middleware are further illustrated.",

Possible causes of uncertainties include changes in the operational environment, dynamics in the availability of resources, and variations of user goals. The aim of self-adaptation is to let the system collect additional data about the uncertainties during operation. The system uses the additional data to resolve uncertainties, to reason about itself, and based on its goals to reconfigure or adjust itself to satisfy the changing conditions, or if necessary to degrade gracefully. In this chapter, we provide a particular perspective on the evolution of the field of self-adaptation in six waves. These waves put complementary aspects of engineering self-adaptive systems in focus that synergistically have contributed to the current knowledge in the field. From the presented perspective on the field, we outline a number of challenges for future research in self-adaptation, both in a short and long term.",

A very characteristic example is the air quality forecasts, which are usually encoded in image maps of heterogeneous formats, while the initial (numerical) pollutant concentrations, calculated and predicted by a relevant model, remain unavailable. This work addresses the task of semi-automatic extraction of such information based on a template configuration tool, on methodologies for data reconstruction from images, as well as on Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques.

		"abstract": "Sensors integrated into the environment, machinery, and structures, and coupled with the efficient delivery of sensed information could provide tremendous benefits in a wide range of applications such as improved manufacturing productivity, enhanced homeland security, fewer catastrophic failures, and improved emergency response. The design and development of these applications should address the challenges dictated by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) characteristics on the one hand and the targeted applications on the other hand. One of the novel emerging approaches used to address these challenges is the design of middleware for WSN. Middleware refers to distributed software that can bridge the gap and remove impediments between the heterogeneous hardware platform and the backend applications requirements. In recent years, research has been carried out on WSN middleware from different aspects and for different purposes. WSN can be used with other identification technologies such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). In an integration system of RFID and WSN, RFID is used to identify objects while WSN can provide context environment information about these objects. This integration increases system intelligence in pervasive computing. This chapter provides a comprehensive review of the existing middleware for WSN, seeking for a better understanding of the current issues and future directions in this field. It also examines the various approaches of middleware design, compares and suggests different types of applications where each approach can be used. Finally, it proposes an enhanced middleware framework; FlexRFID for the integration of RFID and WSN.",

		"abstract": "The modernization of animal production as well as demographic changes in rural areas has resulted in difficult cohabitation problems in some regions of Canada. This chapter focuses on three predominant air quality issues associated with modern farming: odour, particulate matter and ammonia. Odour can adversely affect quality of life, lead to socio-emotional nuisances and cause genuine physical symptoms. Odours are mainly associated with confined animal farming operations, especially exhaust from animal housing, storage of animal wastes, application of manure to land. Particulate matter (PM) is now well known to be potentially toxic to humans. Agricultural PM is emitted from soil erosion tillage and livestock buildings. Ammonia contributes somewhat to odour but more importantly reacts in the atmosphere to form fine secondary particulates, also a potential health concern. Ammonia is emitted from livestock wastes (especially urine and uric acid) and from urea or ammonia containing fertilizers. Ammonia in the particulate form travels long distances and can damage certain plant communities and ecosystems. Good farming practices often reduce impact on air quality: examples include precise feeding of protein which reduced excretion of urea, injection of manure and fertilizer, and reduced tillage and summerfallow in crop production which reduces PM. In some cases, to reduce complaints, it may be necessary to regulate separation in space or time between the public and farming operations.",

Using a joint source/channel coding approach, WaveVideo offers a high degree of error tolerance on noisy channels, still being competitive in terms of compression. Adaptation to channel conditions and user requirements is implemented on three levels. The coding itself features spatial and temporal measures to conceal transmission errors. Additionally, the amount of introduced error-control information is controlled by feedback. The video stream coding, applied to multicast capable networks, can serve different users needs efficiently at the same time by scaling the video stream in the network according to receivers quality requirements. The WaveVideo architecture is unique in terms of its capability to use QoS mapping and adaptation functions across all network nodes providing the same uniform interface.",

		"abstract": "Pervasive computing applications envision sensor rich computing and networking environments that can capture various types of contexts of inhabitants of the environment, such as their locations, activities, vital signs, and environmental measures. Such context information is useful in a variety of applications, for example to manage health information to promote independent living in aging-in-place scenarios. In reality, both sensed and interpreted contexts are often ambiguous, leading to potentially dangerous decisions if not properly handled. Thus, a significant challenge facing the development of realistic and deployable context-aware services for pervasive computing applications is the ability to deal with these ambiguous contexts. In this paper, we propose a resource optimized quality assured context mediation framework for resource constrained sensor networks based on efficient context-aware data fusion and information theoretic sensor parameter selection for optimal state estimation. The proposed framework provides a systematic approach based on dynamic Bayesian networks to derive context fragments and deal with context ambiguity or error in a probabilistic manner. Experimental results using SunSPOT sensors demonstrate the promise of this approach.",

		"abstract": "An assessment of air quality in the vicinity of a selected school has been carried out by monitoring the concentrations of primary pollutants. The results has shown that during the school hours, the measured pollutants emitted from the cars next to the selected school, such as CO and NO2, are always under the allowable limits for Kuwaiti air quality standards. On the other hand, the concentrations of non methane hydrocarbon pollutant (nm-HC), some of which are considered to be cancergenic, are found to be above the Kuwaiti standard most of the times. A traffic counter is used to record the number of cars in the main road next to the school in 15Â min intervals for 10Â days during the monitoring period for air quality. Statistical analysis is performed to develop a relation for prediction of the necessary reduction in traffic, based on CO concentrations, during morning and afternoon periods on working days. A computer dispersion model (CALINE4) is also used to assess the CO concentrations based on recorded flow of traffic and emission inventory with the prevailing meteorological conditions existed at the specified time. After the validation of model, different scenarios have been evaluated to provide an acceptable solution to resolve the traffic congestion problem near the schools in the early morning hours with substantial reduction in pollution levels. The optimal solution for CO concentration reduction by managing smooth traffic flow is to reduce the traffic intensity by half in early morning and afternoon rush hours. The results of the predicted CO concentration in the vicinity of the school for the model and the statistical analysis has shown reduction of 30% and 42% respectively, for approximately 50% decrease in the car use. On the other hand the predicted CO concentration for the model and the statistics reached 24% and 33% respectively when 50% of students opted for buses instead of using private cars.",

In this study, the risk priority number of failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) was employed to determine improvement priorities for service demands. This methodology facilitates constructing a comprehensive Aging in Place policy and increases effective use of resources. The Aging in Place categories and policies are crucial. QFD and FMEA techniques were used in this study to design an Aging in Place policy and meet elderly people demands, provide a clear design, and improve service quality to match the demands and expectations of elderly people. The 16 service demands were identified by the experts and scholars.

First, it aims at reviewing the basic ATM traffic control functions, as defined by the standards, addressing popular methods that are used for performance analysis of ATM multiplexing and, then, bending critically over controversial issues in this area; among these issues is the suitability of statistical models for traffic control, the effectiveness of rate-based control schemes as well as the advantages and disadvantages of using effective rates as traffic descriptors. Motivated by the results of this critical analysis, the second part of the paper is devoted to a new approach to the ATM traffic control problem. Taking into account the foreseen convergence between IP and ATM, it focuses on a burst-level modelling through the classical M/G/1 model, which essentially ignores cell-level details within bursts, including the cell rate itself, and exploits the buffering gain, assuming a large buffer_space/burst_size ratio.",

This is due to the identification of molecular markers tightly linked to chromosome regions involved in the control of important quality characteristics such as dough properties, grain hardness, semolina and flour colour, grain protein content and starch composition, which strongly influence wheat end use, and its nutritional and market value. Marker assisted selection (MAS) will increase the efficiency of the breeding process, particularly when phenotyping requires laborious and time-consuming analyses, performed in advanced generations because of the relatively large amount of grain required. Moreover, the implementation of MAS allows the selection of individuals carrying the favourable alleles at the target loci, and also the pyramiding of favourable QTL alleles from different sources and for different traits. This not withstanding, the progress obtained until now in applying MAS to quality characteristics has been slow compared to other traits.",

The trend nowadays is to proceed to an efficient integration of multimedia services on the broadband infrastructure which emerges with the advent of ATM networks. To this end, an enhanced quality management architecture is needed, to enable Quality of Service (QoS) control at multiple levels, while taking into account the environment of modern networks, wherein multiple services are made available by multiple operators. This paper establishes the rationale for Total Quality Management (TQM) in broadband communications and focuses on the generic principles to which the design of a quality management system must adhere. An approach to the implementation of TQM applications is suggested and the policy-driven nature of quality management practices is illustrated. Finally the paper provides an overview of the testbed of the TOMQAT project (RACE 2116), upon which experimentation and validation of the TQM model and its engineering principles will take place.",

This project is divided in three phases: the definition of the requirements and scenarios, the development of a new robotic platform, and the evaluation. This work presents the results obtained in the first phase, in which several meetings were conducted with a set of subject-matter experts in the areas of Alzheimers Disease and social robotics. The meetings were classified according to the application areas they covered: general aspects, safety, entertainment, personal assistance, and stimulation. The meetings ended up with a repertory of scenarios where robots can be applied to Alzheimers patients and their caregivers at their home or in longterm care facilities. These scenarios present different psychological, social and technical concerns that must be addressed for the design of the robot. In this work we perform an analysis on the scenarios and present the technical requirements for the development of a first robotic prototype. This prototype will be constructed and tested in real environments in the subsequent phases of the RobAlz project.",

Our work benefits from the products of project RoboCare, namely, a domestic environment in which sensors, intelligent software components and a domestic robot provide a set of cognitive support services for the elder user. This paper analyzes a number of evaluation criteria in detail, specifically related to the robots aspect, the way in which it communicates with the user, and the perceived usefulness of its support services. Among these criteria, the paper proposes and reports an evaluation of the Proactive interaction modality (where the system takes the initiative) and On-demand interaction (in which the user explicitly requests a service). Users evaluate the On-demand support services in personal safety scenarios as particularly useful, and less so in scenarios which are not critical. The paper also provides a discussion which can be useful for the design of future assistive agents and robotic companions.",

Further, the definitions of quality of care from the perspectives of the clients are rare (e.g. Baldock & Hadlow, 2002; Bowling, 1997), and same regards definitions of quality from a multi-professional perspective (Nies & Berman, 2004). Regarding the quality of long-term care of older people, homecare seems to lack quality definitions (e.g. Palj\"arvi, Rissanen, & Sinkkonen, 2003; Thome, Dykes, & Rahm Hallberg, 2003), more often than nursing care and institutional care (e.g. Ranz, Zwygart-Stauffacher, & Popejoy, 1999).",

In comforting conservative confines that day, Santorum completed his trifecta of impolitic remarks by painting himself as a jobs-creator while President Obama a narcissist when Santorum further explained that while he would assist the blue collar, Midwestern parents in raising children to reflect conservative values and work ethic, President Obama would angle to remake conservatives children in his image,3 meaning elite and/or liberal.",

The quest for vaccine candidates to control these arthropod vectors remains pivotal and only rationale approach in controlling these diseases. Several candidate antigens have been screened over the years of which 4D8 tick protective antigen have shown promising results in controlling ixodid tick infestations. The 4D8 tick protective antigen is a structural and functional ortholog of insect subolesin/akirin and an evolutionary conserved protein, associated with multiple essential cellular processes in tick biology. Variable efficacy of recombinant subolesin/4D8 vaccine in field trials propels the approach towards synthetic peptide vaccine through reverse vaccinology. Advancement in reverse vaccinology has opened a new paradigm in the search of a perfect candidate antigen. The present study focused on full length amplification, cloning and sequencing of the 4D8 gene from Hyalomma antolicum. Combination of bioinformatics analysis and computational modeling tools identified linear as well as conformational B-cell and MHC class II epitopes conserved in many ixodid ticks which may be useful to design an universal synthetic peptide vaccine against multiple tick species. Western blot analysis using rabbit antisera against recombinant 4D8 protein has also confirmed the immunogenic potential of the candidate.",

The testbed supports delivery of MPEG-2 audio/video stored as transport streams over various types of networks, e.g., ATM, Ethernet, and wireless. Both software and hardware video encoders/decoders are used in the testbed. A real-time video pump and a distributed application control protocol (MPEG-2s DSM-CC) have been incorporated. Hardware decoders and set-tops are being used to test wide-area video interoperability. Our VoD testbed also provides an advanced platform for implementing proof-of-concept prototypes of related research. Our current research focus covers video transmission with heterogeneous quality-of-service (QoS) provision, variable bitrate (VBR) traffic modeling, VBR server scheduling, video over Internet, and video transmission over IP-ATM hybrid networks. An important aim is to enhance interoperability. Accommodation of practical multimedia applications and interoperability testing with external VoD systems has also been undertaken.",

The objectives of this White Paper are threefold: (1) to present the current state of affairs of EDeAN, active since 2002 as part of the European Commissions action line supporting the development of the European Information Society; (2) to outline a roadmap for future initiatives, actively reflecting views of the EDeAN network in specific domains related to DfA, e-Accessibility and e-Inclusion; and (3) to bring forward a set of suggestions and recommendations regarding the activities of the network, aiming to support the creation of a fully inclusive European Information Society. The paper is organised as follows: Section 1 provides a short introduction to DfA and Accessibility in Information Society (IS) and Information Society Technology (IST) developments in Europe. Section 2 provides an overview of policy as well as R&D activities related to DfA and accessibility in IST in Europe. Section 3 briefly describes the role of EDeAN and the new challenges that emerge as a result of the changing European policy environment. Section 4 presents current challenges that emerge in five domains directly related to DfA and accessibility, such as policy and legislation, industry, monitoring and evaluation---benchmarking, standardisation, R&D, and education and training. Finally, Sect. 5 puts forward a number of recommendations with regard to future activities for EDeAN. The contents of this paper reflect results from the open discussion forums supported in the EDeAN website (ref: EDeAN Special Interest Groups, SIGs). The draft paper was written by the EDeAN Secretariat for 2005, FORTH-ICS (Greece), and completed with the support of all NCCs. Support was also provided by the European Commission DG Information Society and Media and by the D4ALLnet project (ref: an EC funded project with the code IST-2001-38833).",

		"abstract": "More and more software applications have to be able to dynamically change during execution in order to adapt to changes in their environment. In the context of architecture-centred software development, this capability has to be expressed at the architectural level, inducing the need of architecture description languages capable of representing dynamic architectures. In this paper we propose an architecture description language for dynamic software architectures, the ArchWare C&C-ADL. This language uses the component-connector view, and is constructed as an architectural style on top of a more generic ADL, the ArchWare $pi$-ADL (formal ADL based on strongly typed $pi$-calculus). The mechanisms the language offers for the management of dynamic behaviour of software systems, as well as all the advantages of the language design are stressed in the paper. We illustrate the language concepts using dynamic client server architectures.",

		"abstract": "This chapter presents a comprehensive overview of short term wind forecasting models based on time series analysis. Several different approaches, presently considered as mature, are re-examined with an eye towards setting automated procedures to clarify grey areas in their application. Additionally, some approaches recently proposed in the literature are examined that include the application of localized linear models, and clustering algorithms coupled with linear and nonlinear models. Additionally, the impact of changing synoptic weather characteristics is captured, through the utilization of global meteorological variables and the subsequent development of a customized regime model. The application of the developed approach on an annual hourly wind speed data set is presented.",

The use of low cost wireless sensor networks (WSN) provides many advantages for sustainable building automation solutions. In this paper, we analyzed the WSN related requirements for sustainable building automation operations and maintenance. We used the three sustainability dimensions, economic, environment and social, to gather the requirements. The requirement analysis resulted in 10 requirements aiming at maximization of energy conservation, lowering of operation and maintenance costs while taking into accounts the users or occupants preferences, comfort, and safety.",

This paper has designed and developed a machine learning based methodology to derive QoE for online video systems. For this purpose, a platform has been developed where video content is unicasted to users so that objective video metrics are collected into a database. At the end of each video session, users are queried with a subjective survey about their experience. Both quantitative statistics and qualitative user survey information are used as training data to a variety of machine learning techniques including Artificial Neural Network (ANN), K-nearest Neighbours Algorithm (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a collection of cross-validation strategies. This methodology can efficiently answer the problem of predicting user experience for any online video service provider, while overcoming the problematic interpretation of subjective consumer experience in terms of quantitative system capacity metrics.",

		"abstract": "This study was aimed at investigating the influence of starch pregelatinisation of maize flour, through grit steaming, on the quality characteristics of maize tuwo (non-fermented food dumpling). Maize grits were variously steamed, batchwise, for a period of 15, 30, 45 and 60Â min respectively from which flour was obtained. The damaged starch value (13.4--16.2Â %) of the pregelatinised maize flour increased with an increase in the steaming duration while that from 0-min steaming period was 12.2Â %. The water absorption capacity (3.2--3.7Â g/g) and oil absorption capacity (2.1--2.5Â g/g) of the pregelatinised maize flour increased with an increase in the steaming duration while those from 0-min steaming period were 2.1Â g/g and 2.0Â g/g respectively. The pasting variables were found to decrease with an increase in the steaming duration include the peak viscosity (80.5--106.1Â RVU), breakdown viscosity (17.9--23.1Â RVU), final viscosity (102.4--136.8Â RVU), setback-I (41.9--56.6Â RVU) and setback-II (21.9--35.5Â RVU) while those from 0-min steaming period were 108.3, 36.9, 147.4, 76.0 and 39.1Â RVU respectively. The colour characteristics of maize flours and tuwo showed that the L*-value of the flours (85.2--88.7) and tuwo (65.1--67.2) decreased with an increase in the steaming duration while those from 0-min steaming period were 90.0 and 67.7 respectively. The rheological properties of maize tuwo showed that the strain at peak, taken as the cohesiveness index of the food product, ranged between 18.0 and 21.7Â % while that from 0-min steaming period was 15.4Â %. The softness index of the food product also ranged between 17.5Â mm and 17.9Â mm while that from 0-min steaming period was 17.4Â mm. The sensory quality rating of maize tuwo prepared from the pregelatinised flour showed that the food product obtained from the 30-min steaming duration was rated the highest in terms of texture (mouldability), taste and overall acceptability.",

Both software and hardware video encoders/decoders are used in the testbed. A real-time video pump and a distributed application control protocol (MPEG-2s DSM-CC) have been incorporated. Hardware decoders and set-tops are being used to test wide-area video interoperability. Our VoD testbed also provides an advanced platform for implementing proof-of-concept prototypes of related research. Our current research focus covers video transmission with heterogeneous quality-of-service (QoS) provision, variable bitrate (VBR) traffic modeling, VBR server scheduling, video over Internet, and video transmission over IP-ATM hybrid networks. An important aim is to enhance interoperability. Accommodation of practical multimedia applications and interoperability testing with external VoD systems has also been undertaken.",

Despite the significant ageing of the population and the growing number of persons likely to become dependent on long-term care, Italy is a latecomer in activating care policies and in responding comprehensively to long-term care needs linked to demographic transformations. In particular, uniform social services securing long-term care are still missing. Major target groups of public interventions are either adult persons with severe disabilities below the retirement age, or senior persons beyond retirement age with specific functional impairments.",

In respect to their geographical scope and the number of computers that can be connected over them, LANs, however, do have technical limitations. Different operational criteria, such as cost, throughput rate, spatial expansion and arrangement have led to the development of widely varying LAN technologies.

Even low packet loss ratios (PLRs) can significantly reduce the video quality. In this paper, a packet level parity Forward Error Correction (FEC) is applied to the video stream in order to reduce the video PLR. A constant gross data rate is assumed, such that adding a FEC leads to a decrease in effective video data rate. The FEC block is truncated at the end of each video VOP, such that there are no inter-VOP dependencies for FEC correction. An algorithm is proposed to optimize the FEC length, based on the Quality of Experience as modelled by the ITU-T R G.1070 standard. It is shown that the optimization algorithm can significantly increase the video quality, without increasing the gross data rate. The algorithm has been evaluated both analytically and through simulations, which confirm the very significant increases in subjective video quality.",

		"abstract": "Multimedia content delivery has become one of the pillar services of modern day mobile and fixed networks. The variety of devices, platforms, and content providers together with increasing network capacity has impacted the popularity of this type of service. Considering this context, it is crucial to ensure end-to-end service quality that can fulfill users expectations. The user quality of experience (QoE) for multimedia streaming is tempered by numerous objective and subjective parameters; therefore, it is important to understand the relationships among them. In this paper, we thoroughly examine the impact of packet loss on user QoE in cases when multimedia streaming service is based on underlying User Datagram Protocol. The dependencies between the chosen objective and subjective parameters and the user QoE were examined in a real-life environment by conducting a survey with 602 test subjects who rated the quality of a 1-h documentary film (72 different test sequences were prepared for the rating process). Based on the obtained results, we ranked the objective parameters by their order of importance in relation to their impact on user QoE as follows: (1) total duration of packet loss occurrences (PLOs), i.e., quality distortions in a video; (2) number of PLOs; (3) packet loss rate; and (4) duration of a single PLO. We also demonstrated how the overall user experience can be redeemed, despite the perceived quality distortions, if the content is entertaining to the viewer. The user experience was also found to be influenced by the existence/non-existence of video subtitles.",

So far, usability metrics that are accessible and useful for software developers are still missing. Although usability standards are continually being developed and adapted to the rapid change in both software and computing hardware, the increasing diversity of elderly populations, both culturally and educationally, requires the development of a specific set of criteria. This paper studies two different aspects of usability for the elderly; passive and active interaction. It explores the limitations of active interaction, its potential causes and results. The long term goal is the development of new methods to counteract potential negative bias with regard to passive interaction. More specifically, we are investigating achievable metrics for the evaluation of passive technology trustworthiness and usability while categorizing them according to applicability for usability testing.",

		"abstract": "Malting changes the chemical and enzymatical composition of barley. During malting, enzymes are synthesized, cell walls (pentosans, proteins, etc.) degraded and starch becomes available for enzymatic attack. The progress of germination defines the final beer quality and processability in several aspects: mouthfeel, foam and haze formation (different proteins), processability (viscosity caused by certain substances, like $beta$-glucan), fermentation progress (FAN, sugar content), etc. The objective of this research was to study the influence of different modified malt on turbidity in beer after filtration. This was achieved by analyzing selected malts at different germination stages and afterward studying their influence on the final beer composition, focusing on protein content and composition. Protein fractions were analyzed using a Lab-on-a-Chip technique, which separates the proteins---based on their molecular weight---by capillary electrophoresis. This analysis was supported by the use of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE). Additionally, common malt and beer analyses and turbidity and filterability measurements were performed. The protein composition could be followed from malt to beer with both the Lab-on-a-Chip technique and 2D-PAGE. No differences in protein composition could be seen in the final protein composition of the beer. However, it could be observed, with Lab-on-a-Chip technique, that high amounts of a protein fraction with a size of 25--28Â kDa caused increased turbidity in the beer.",

The cassava flour was added to maize flour at the level of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25% and 30% (w/w), respectively. The bulk density and water holding capacity of maize/cassava flour mixes ranged from 0.77--0.83 g/cm3 and 1.91--2.05 g/g, respectively, while those of 100% maize flour were 0.84 g/cm3 and 2.09 g/g, respectively. There were variations in the pasting properties of maize/cassava flour mixes including the pasting temperature (75.4--78.8textdegreeC), peak viscosity (112.1--170.0Â RVU), breakdown viscosity (38.4--53.7Â RVU) and final viscosity (132.1--142.2Â RVU), while those of 100% maize flour were 74.6textdegreeC, 108.1 RVU, 38.1 RVU and 148.3 RVU, respectively. The colour characteristics of tuwo prepared from maize/cassava flour mixes showed an increase in the colour lightness, L*-value (68.6--71.8) and chroma, C-value (9.4--11.4) while tuwo from 100% maize flour gave 67.7 and 9.1, respectively. The cohesiveness indexes (15.4--24.2%) of tuwo from maize/cassava flour mixes increased with an increase in the quantity of cassava flour in the mix while that from 100% maize flour was 15.2%. The softness indexes (17.5--18.4textdegreemm) of tuwo from the mixes were also higher than that from 100% maize flour (17.4textdegreemm).

		"abstract": "The popularity of mobile devices and conversational agents in recent years has seen wide use of chatbots in different educational scenarios. In relation to the advances in mobile devices and conversational agents, there are few research works concerning the design and evaluation of domain-specific chatbots to fulfill the demand of mobile learning. To address this issue, we propose an agent-based conceptual architecture to develop a domain-specific chatbot for mobile learning. We extend the open-domain DeepQA agent to make it sensitive to restricted domain questions by building a domain-specific gate, and employ WeChat as user interface. To evaluate our chatbot, subjective and objective criteria are employed to assess its effectiveness. Additionally, its usability evaluation proceeds with system usability scale questionnaire and net promoter score simultaneously. In total, 18 domain experts participated in the evaluation of effectiveness, and 52 participants were involved in the evaluation of usability. Based on the evaluation results, we conclude that our chatbot can serve as an effective information retrieval tool in a specific domain. The perceived usability of our chatbot tends to be moderate and marginal and has positively affected the promotion of our chatbot for mobile learning. This paper contributes to the educative application of chatbots in specific subject fields.",

The focus is on the design of user interfaces and design strategies aimed at their versatility and adaptability to different user profiles and different user contexts. Within this chapter special attention is paid to digital technologies for learning and the functional and cognitive aspects that are able to generate the condition of social inclusion.",

		"abstract": "Breeding for complex multigenic phenotypic quality characters in cereals by chemical analyses and functional pilot tests is traditionally a slow and expensive process. The development of new instrumental screening methods for complex quality traits evaluated by multivariate data analysis has during the last decades revolutionised the economy and scale in breeding for quality. The traditional explorative plant breeding view is pragmatically oriented to manipulate the whole plant and its environment by top down observation and selection to improve complex traits, such as yield and baking quality. The new molecular and biochemical techniques are promising in increasing the genetic variation by breaking the barriers of species and in explaining the chemical and genetic basis of quality. In molecular biology traits are seen bottom up from the genome perspective, for example, to find genetic markers by quantitative trait loci (QTL). To improve efficiency the plant breeder can now complement his classical tools of observation by overviewing the whole physical--chemical composition of the seed by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) from a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) score plot to connect to genetic, (bio)chemical, and technological data through pattern recognition data analysis (chemometrics). Genes and genotypes can also be directly evaluated as imprints in NIR spectra. Recent applications in NIR technology by data breeding demonstrate manual selection for complex high-quality traits and seed genotypes directly from a PCA score plot. New equipment makes automatic analysis and sorting for complex quality traits possible both in bulk and on single seed basis. Seed sorting can be used directly in seed production and to speed up selection for quality traits in early generations of plant breeding and to document genetic diversity in gene banks.",

We adopt a design research approach by focusing on the design problem of designing user centered systems and by applying a framework based on The anatomy of a design theory [1], to better understand the nature of current User Centered Design methods. Our discussion brings to both a deep understanding on the design problem domain (the design of User Centered Systems) and a conceptual contribution at the meta-level of the design research debate. Interaction designers can benefit from the proposed conceptualization by following a more holistic approach in the analysis of the context of use. As a consequence IT artifacts are expected to better fit with the dynamics of socio-technical systems at different levels (i.e. individual, group, organizational, institutional, etc.). The value of our proposal lies in the approach adopted for conducting the research and in the research outcome itself (design theory).",

This paper is about the representation of an ad hoc composition of elementary recognition service in order to form an integrated recognition facilities, to be deployed within the scope of energy-aware systems. We aim to investigate the types of useful collaboration among IRSs components and to present a tool to assist designers both in the design process and in the system deployment phase. The tool define a catalogue of elementary recognition services that are typically associated with single trait recognition modules. They are considered as prototypical services that can be differentiated by proper parameter settings. Those basic building blocks can form compound collaborative patterns: composition rules are expressed both as logical association and causal relation (what-if rules). The recognition activity can be organized through different levels and feedback is allowed. Partition let to evaluate the overall QoS from performance figures that are associated with the elementary blocks, in order to certify expected Service Level Agreements (SLA)s. Deployment represents an important step before system release. The proposed approach is an interactive one: system administrators are asked to allocate all the components on actual machines and secure communication channels are automatically established. Scalability, redundancy and fault tolerance and energy issues can be addressed at this level.",

Long-term care facilities began as poor houses and religious care homes in response to the need for care of the elderly and infirm. Following the addition of Medicare and Medicaid as payer sources, the long-term care industry exploded. Anyone could start a nursing home if they had the money and the building to house the patients. Nursing homes were first developed to replicate the acute care setting and were often attached to the acute care setting with physicians as the administrators. As for-profit entities entered the long-term care arena, the nursing home became freestanding and without the medical connection to a specific hospital or physician group. The development of assisted living facilities provided another avenue to break into the long-term care market and make an even greater profit than was realized in the nursing home setting. With the majority of assisted living facilities only private-pay, the profit margins grew, creating an environment of growth and expansion.",

		"abstract": "During summer of 1989, a network for the analysis of spatial variability of rainwater quality was operated on Montreal Island. Six bulk samplers distributed on the territory were used for this purpose. A total of 97 storm-station events have been analyzed for pH, conductivity, Total Organic Carbon, nitrate, sulphate, calcium and magnesium. A canonical discriminant analysis shows that as a whole, there is no statistically significant discrimination between stations. However, Tukeys test for means shows that mean pH is significantly different between downtown and peripheric stations. The pH is higher in downtown. Finally, a variance analysis shows that variations with respect to time are greater than those on a spatial basis. Thus, the Montreal Island can be considered as spatially homogeneous for most rainwater quality parameters.",

		"abstract": "This article is aimed to describe the method of testing the implementation of voice control over operating and technical functions of Smart Home Come. Custom control over operating and technical functions was implemented into a model of Smart Home that was equipped with KNX technology. A sociological survey focused on the needs of seniors has been carried out to justify the implementation of voice control into Smart Home Care. In the real environment of Smart Home Care, there are usually unwanted signals and additive noise that negatively affect the voice communication with the control system. This article describes the addition of a sophisticated system for filtering the additive background noise out of the voice communication with the control system. The additive noise significantly lowers the success of recognizing voice commands to control operating and technical functions of an intelligent building. Within the scope of the proposed application, a complex system based on fuzzy-neuron networks, specifically the ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Interference System) for adaptive suppression of unwanted background noises was created. The functionality of the designed system was evaluated both by subjective and by objective criteria (SSNR, DTW). Experimental results suggest that the studied system has the potential to refine the voice control of technical and operating functions of Smart Home Care even in a very noisy environment.",

In this paper the integration of remanufacturing in the production of new units is introduced in order to enable a shift of remanufactured products from used to new ones. The opportunity for this approach is explained based on the example of household appliances.",

		"abstract": "Recently, non-thermal plasma-activated water (PAW) became a relatively new concept developed in the food industry. The effects of PAW on fruit decay, microbial loads, and quality of postharvest Chinese bayberry were investigated. Chinese bayberries were treated by PAW for 0.5, 2, or 5Â min and then stored at 3Â textdegreeC for 8Â days. Experimental results show that all PAW treatments could reduce fruit decay by around 50Â % compared to control at the end of storage. There was no dose-effect relationship between PAW treatment time and fruit decay. Meanwhile, a 0.5-min PAW treatment could remarkably decrease microbial population on Chinese bayberries during storage, and the maximum reductions reached around 1.1 log CFU/g both for bacteria and fungi at the end day of storage. Scanning electron microscopy results reveal that PAW could significantly change the morphology of microbial cells on Chinese bayberries. Moreover, physicochemical properties analysis of PAW demonstrates that the microbial inactivation of PAW is mainly attributed to the combined action of high oxidation reduction potential and low pH. Additionally, PAW-treated fruits exhibited markedly higher firmness, color index of red grapes, and total soluble solids than the control did at the eighth day. These results indicate that PAW might be a promising strategy to control fruit decay and maintain quality of Chinese bayberry during postharvest storage.",

One of the basic tasks of knowledge discovery and data mining is to synthesize the description of some subsets (concepts) of entities contained in databases. The patterns and/or rules extracted from data are used as basic tools for concept description. In this Chapter we propose a certain framework for approximating concepts. Our approach emphasizes extracting regularities from data. In this Chapter the following problems are investigated: (1) issues concerning the languages used to represent patterns; (2) computational complexity of problems in approximating concepts; (3) methods of identifying, optimal patterns. Data regularity is a useful tool not only for concept description. It is also indispensable for various applications like classification or decomposition. In this Chapter we present also the applications of data regularity to three basic problems of data mining: classification, data description and data decomposition.",

Pasta samples were prepared from the above mentioned wheat semolina with and without additives (ascorbic acid, dry gluten powder, hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose, and glycerol mono stearate) using lab scale extruder. Pasta samples were evaluated for pasting, protein profiles, cooking, texture, color, sensory, and microstructure parameters. The results indicated that T. aestivum semolina gave the lowest onset gelatinization temperature (66.9Â textdegreeC) but the highest peak viscosity (1,053Â BU). The T. aestivum pasta had a cream color (bthinspace=thinspace15.69) while the T. dicoccum pasta was brownish (bthinspace=thinspace11.91, athinspace=thinspace5.89). The cooking loss was more in the case of T. aestivum pasta (8.20%) compared with T. durum (6.90%) and T. dicoccum (7.12%) samples. Texture studies indicated that T. aestivum pasta had the least ratings on shear value (1.80Â N) and overall sensory score of 6.21Â N whereas shear value of 2.42Â N and sensory scores of 6.89 after T. dicoccum pasta was comparable with that of T. durum pasta (2.46Â N and 7.19Â N). Scanning electron micrograph studies supported this. It was observed from the results obtained from gel filtration chromatograph that protein subunits play an important role in deciding pasta-making quality of different wheat species. The study also indicated that pasta quality of T. aestivum and T. dicoccum could be improved with unique combination of additives.",

		"abstract": "The net result of acid-generating and-neutralizing reactions within mining wastes is termed acid rock drainage (ARD). The oxidation of sulfide minerals is the major contributor to acid generation. Dissolution and alteration of various minerals can contribute to the neutralization of acid. Definitions of alkalinity, acidity, and buffer capacity are reviewed, and a detailed discussion of the dissolution and neutralizing capacity of carbonate and silicate minerals related to equilibium conditions, dissolution mechanism, and kinetics is provided. Factors that determine neutralization rate by carbonate and silicate minerals include: pH, PCO2, equilibrium conditions, temperature, mineral composition and structure, redox conditions, and the presence of foreign ions. Similar factors affect sulfide oxidation. Comparison of rates shows sulfides react fastest, followed by carbonates and silicates. The differences in the reaction mechanisms and kinetics of neutralization have important implications in the prediction, control, and regulation of ARD. Current static and kinetic prediction methods upon which mine permitting, ARD control, and mine closure plans are based do not consider sample mineralogy or the kinetics of the acid-generating and-neutralizing reactions. Erroneous test interpretations and predictions can result. The importance of considering mineralogy for site-specific interpretation is highlighted. Uncertainty in prediction leads to difficulties for the mine operator in developing satisfactory and cost-effective control and remediation measures. Thus, the application of regulations and guidelines for waste management planning need to beflexible.",

The plant is rich in sugars, mono and polysaccharides, polyphenols, fatty acids, sterol derivatives, carotenoids, cynogenic glucosides and volatile compounds. Polyphenols are abundant micronutrients in the human diet, and evidence for their role in the prevention of degenerative diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases is emerging. Cyanogenic glycosides responsible for a bitter taste of apricot seeds and these seeds cause some degree of intoxication primarily on nervous system and thyroid. P. armeniaca L. has also been investigated for various biological activities such as antimicrobial, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, antinociceptive, antiinflammatory, antimutagenic, inhibitory activity against several enzymes. Among them the antimicrobial and antioxidant potential has been of much exploration and were proved to be highly efficacious under in vitro conditions. In the present review, the antioxidant properties of P. armeniaca L. and its potential use as natural dietary supplement has been discussed.

		"abstract": "We call attention to the need for supported decision-making (SDM) in place of substituted decision-making (e.g., guardianship). SDM allows individuals with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities to make their own life choices with self-appointed supporters. Whereas there is a growing recognition that SDM is a needed practice, Americas deep-rooted paternalistic culture makes it difficult to fully embrace SDM models. Recent court rulings portray an evolution of decision making towards SDM as an option for individuals with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities. These court rulings along with widely accepted theories and emerging research supporting SDM have an increasingly critical influence on policymakers in further advancing the rights of persons with disabilities.",

		"abstract": "Accessibility and equal opportunities for all in the digital age have become increasingly important over the last decade. In one form or another, the concept of accessibility is being considered to a greater or smaller extent in most projects that develop interactive systems. However, the concept varies among different professions, cultures and interest groups. Design for all, universal access and inclusive design are all different names of approaches that largely focus on increasing the accessibility of the interactive system for the widest possible range of use. But, in what way do all these concepts differ and what is the underlying philosophy in all of these concepts? This paper aims at investigating the various concepts used for accessibility, its methodological and historical development and some philosophical aspects of the concept. It can be concluded that there is little or no consensus regarding the definition and use of the concept, and consequently, there is a risk of bringing less accessibility to the target audience. Particularly in international standardization the lack of consensus is striking. Based on this discussion, the authors argue for a much more thorough definition of the concept and discuss what effects it may have on measurability, conformance with standards and the overall usability for the widest possible range of target users.",

Box-benken design of experiments was used to design different experimental combinations considering 10 to 20Â g groundnut meal, 6 to 18Â mL beetroot juice and 80 to 90Â g refined wheat flour. Quality attributes such as protein content, antioxidant activity, colour, cooking quality (solid loss, rehydration ratio and cooking time) and sensory acceptability of pasta samples were the dependent variables for the study. The results revealed that pasta samples with higher levels of groundnut meal and beetroot juice were high in antioxidant activity and overall sensory acceptability. The samples with higher content of groundnut meal indicated higher protein contents in them. On the other hand, the samples with higher beetroot juice content were high in rehydration ratio and lesser cooking time along with low solid loss in cooking water. The different level of studied food materials significantly affected the colour quality of pasta samples. Optimized combination for development of nutritious pasta consisted of 20Â g groundnut meal, 18Â mL beetroot juice and 83.49Â g refined wheat flour with overall desirability as 0.905. This pasta sample required 5.5Â min to cook and showed 1.37Â % solid loss and rehydration ratio as 6.28. Pasta sample prepared following optimized formulation provided 19.56Â % protein content, 23.95Â % antioxidant activity and 125.89Â mg/100Â g total phenols with overall sensory acceptability scores 8.71.",

		"abstract": "Although the Dutch child protection system has undergone several major transformations during the last three decades, for many years there has been a clear focus on serving the best interests of children, with the Convention on the Rights of the Child playing a key role. Great efforts are made to prevent child maltreatment or to intervene at an early stage. Large-scale prevalence studies have shown the epidemic scope of child maltreatment in the Netherlands. Both the high prevalence rates of child maltreatment and reviews of serious and fatal cases have led to significant refinements in procedures for identifying different forms of child maltreatment and for reporting. This chapter draws on the policy analysis developed for the research project Hestia, which compares policies and responses to child abuse and neglect in England, Germany and the Netherlands. The chapter begins with an historical overview of the policies and events which have shaped the current child protection system. Next, we describe in detail the present Youth Act 2015 and the scope and organization of the child protection system. In the final section, we formulate a conclusion and outline some challenges for the future of Dutch child protection policy and practice.",

Academic databases and systems such as IEEE Xplore, Scopus, PubMed and Science Direct were searched, considering the date of publication from 2006 until the present time. Several search criteria were established as techniques OR sources AND Big Data AND medicine OR health, techniques AND Big Data AND chronic diseases, etc. Selecting the paper considered of interest regarding the description of the techniques and sources of Big Data in healthcare. It found a total of 110 articles on techniques and sources of Big Data on health from which only 32 have been identified as relevant work. Many of the articles show the platforms of Big Data, sources, databases used and identify the techniques most used in the prediction of chronic diseases. From the review of the analyzed research articles, it can be noticed that the sources and techniques of Big Data used in the health sector represent a relevant factor in terms of effectiveness, since it allows the application of predictive analysis techniques in tasks such as: identification of patients at risk of reentry or prevention of hospital or chronic diseases infections, obtaining predictive models of quality.",

The control strategies that operate on cell level are combinations of storage and retrieval priority policies. In the comparisons, two classes of traffic are distinguished, one class (LL) requiring a low loss probability and one class (LD) requiring a low average delay (jitter). By using the delay-loss plane --- plotting the loss of the LL cells against the delay of the LD cells --- the performance of the various storage and (state-dependent) retrieval policies has been compared for both stationary and time-varying traffic. In a relative ranking of the different policies, the LDOLL threshold policies give the best results, in addition to creating the possibility of setting the threshold according to the desired delay-loss trade-off.",

The EPA has determined that a voluntary approach to cyber security is sufficient for protecting critical infrastructure in this sector. Also, the EPA is in collaborative partnership with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to ensure cyber security in this sector. In 2014, the DHS responded to 14 cyber security incidents reported by the Water Sector. The established techniques of cyber-attacks are documented in this chapter along with a summary of common vulnerabilities. A sector-specific example of a secure-network design architecture is presented and discussed in this chapter. However, the variability of organizational size and availability of resources in this sector makes a template technological approach difficult to implement. While understanding the technological approaches including hacking tools and defense in depth are important countermeasure mechanisms, a cultural approach is necessary to control the human element which makes the selected technological approach a viable measure.",

		"abstract": "Presence based notification systems play a pivotal role in any collaborative working environment by providing near real time information about the status, locality and presence of the collaborators. Instant Messaging (IM) tools provide a simple low cost solution to support communication and collaboration in the working environment. With the wide adoption of smart phones, there is an increasing trend of using IM clients on mobile devices for exchanging and managing presence information. However, in modern organisations the use of collaborative tools is not limited only to IMs, but various other tools are also used, such as project management tools, meeting agenda, calendar and alike. In this paper we design, develop and implement an agile platform for ubiquitous presence management that relies on semantically interlinked vocabularies, existing information extraction tools for semantic enhancement of heterogeneous enterprise collaborative tools, continuous query processing for semantic integration and event detection in dynamic environment, and semantic transformation via query language for event-triggered notification actions based on the users context. We showcase our proposed solution by demonstrating a real world scenario for Ciscos Unified Presence System and we evaluate our solution in terms of requirements for Ubiquitous Presence Management System (UPMS) compared to related solutions, and overhead of each additional processing step, namely semantic transformation, continuous query processing and notification.",

In this context, the use of reference architectures and product line architectures is becoming a common practice. However, both of these concepts are sometimes mistakenly seen as the same thing; it is also not clearly established how they can be explored in a complementary way in order to contribute to software development. The main contribution of this paper is to make a clear differentiation between these architectures, by investigating and establishing definitions for each of them. Based on this, we also propose the use of reference architectures as a basis for product line architectures. As a result, a better understanding of both reference architectures and product line architectures, as well as an understanding of how to explore them jointly, can contribute to promoting more effective reuse in the development of software systems.",

MSCs are easily obtained from various tissue types (e.g. bone marrow, fat, cord blood, etc.), are capable of self-renewal, and could be induced to differentiate into several cell lineages for countless biomedical applications. In addition, when transplanted, MSCs are not detected by immune surveillance, thus do not lead to graft rejection. Moreover, they can home towards affected tissues and induce their therapeutic effect in a cell-base and/or a cell-free manner. These properties, and many others, have made MSCs appealing therapeutic cell candidates (for cell and/or gene therapy) in myriad clinical conditions. However, similar to any other therapeutic tool, MSCs still have their own limitations and grey areas that entail more research for better understanding and optimization. Herein, we present a brief overview of various pre-clinical/clinical applications of MSCs in regenerative medicine and discuss limitations and future challenges.",

A binning approach was developed to classify water quality. Least-impaired conditions had relatively high water column transparency and low concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and orthophosphate. Reference communities in all seasons and salinity zones are characterized by consistently low values of chlorophylla and pheophytin coupled with relative stable proportions of the phytoplankton taxonomic groups and low biomasses of key bloom-forming species. Chlorophyll cell content was lower and less variable and average cell size and seasonal picophytoplankton biomass tended to be greater in the mesohaline and polyhaline reference communities as compared to the impaired communities. Biomass concentrations of the nano-micro phytoplankton size fractions (2--200 $mu$m) in 12 of the 16 season-specific and salinity-specific reference communities were the same or higher than those in impaired habitat conditions, suggesting that nutrient reductions will not decrease the quantity of edible phytoplankton food available to large consumers. High (bloom) and low (bust) biomass events within the impaired phytoplankton communities showed strikingly different chlorophyll cell content and turnover rates. Freshwater flow had little effect on phytoplankton responses to water quality condition in most of the estuary. Improved water column transparency, or clarity, through the reduction of suspended sediments will be particularly important in attaining the reference communities. Significant nitrogen load reductions are also required.",

Carotenoids are natural lipophilic pigments biosynthesized mainly by plants, and certain bacteria and fungi. Cereals, although having a low carotenoid content when compared with the majority of fruits and vegetables, may have an important impact in the nutritional status of consumers. The daily consumption of cereals, and products derived from them, by a large part of the population, especially in under-developed and developing countries, makes cereals a contributor of carotenoids which should not be overlooked and must be taken into consideration in biofortification strategies. In the present manuscript, we revise the existing information about the composition and distribution of carotenoids in cereals, highlighting factors which alter their profile, such as domestication of wild varieties, genotype, storage, milling and processing techniques. Strategies for stimulating the carotenoid content in cereals, either by means of traditional breeding methods or by genetic manipulation, are also discussed.",

		"abstract": "Given the potential of wild and semi-domesticated varieties of crop plants as genetic sources of stress tolerance-related traits, along with a capability of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) in promoting plant growth under adverse environmental conditions, response of a hulled tetraploid wheat, in comparison to a durum cultivar, to saline water at the presence of three PGPR strains was examined in a field study. Changes in some physiological attributes including chlorophyll (chl) a, b, and total chl (chl-tot), proline, soluble carbohydrates, Na+ and K+ concentrations, Na+/K+ and grain yield and its attributes, dry mass and harvest index in Joneghan as a hulled tetraploid wheat and Yavaroos as a durum wheat cultivar were studied using a 3-replicate split-plot randomized complete block experiment. Irrigation water salt levels (control, 100 and 200Â mM of NaCl) were chosen as main plots, and the two tetraploid wheat genotypes and three PGPR strains (550, 57, and UW3) and bacteria-free control were considered as subplots. The 200Â mM salt level led to significant decreases in chl-a, chl-b, chl-tot, LAI, K+, grain yield/m2, grains/spike, spikes/m2, grains/m2, 1000-grain weight, dry mass, and harvest index; however, it led to significant increases in Na+, Na+/K+, proline, and soluble carbohydrate contents of the two tetraploid wheat types. Salinity adversely affected the latter traits in the two types of tetraploid wheat in, almost, a same manner and proportion, except for dry mass and harvest index, proving that the hulled tetraploid wheat is not notably different from the durum wheat in its response to the saline water. Bacterial strains effects on the above-mentioned traits varied with salt level. Strain UW3 appeared to leave mitigative effects at 200Â mM and strain 550 did not seem potent to ameliorate the salt stress even at the 100Â mM NaCl level. From the data obtained in the present study, we can conclude that the PGPR efficacy in mitigating salt stress in tetraploid wheat is salt level and bacterial strain specific. The Joneghan hulled tetraploid wheat was out-performed by the Yavaroos durum wheat, though its yield penalty due to saline water did not appear to differ from that of the latter durum genotype.",

Subjects (N = 30) reduced their normal sleep time to increase the likelihood that they would experience rapid eye movement (REM) sleep [closely associated with nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT)]. They then reported to an outpatient psychophysiological laboratory for an early morning nap, during which sleep and penile tumescence measures were recorded continuously. All subjects were able to sleep during at least 1 of their 2 recording sessions, 24 (80%) experienced REM sleep, and 22 (73%) experienced tumescence episodes consistent with previous NPT studies. The magnitude of these erections could reduce concerns about the presence of organic pathology, and obviate the need for an NPT study. Results suggest that monitoring tumescence during naps may be useful as an inexpensive and convenient screening approach in the assessment of male erectile functioning.",

The position of this regionE, as inferred from haploid segregation data, shows a remarkable correlation with the position of the eliminated segment which is haploid, and mostly ofF --- origin, in otherwise diploid heterozygotes. In addition, segregations are disturbed by irregular pairing, which determines apparent negative interference, and seriously biases the assessment of gene order and estimation of linkage unless taken in proper consideration. The simplest representation calls for a single linkage group, carrying in the middle the elimination locusE, and thus dividing the single chromosome into two practically independent segregation groups. Although this picture may need further refinement, as there may be more than one elimination locus or break defining the extremes of the eliminated region, it has permitted consistent mapping of the markers investigated so far.",

The scale of this demographic transition is unique in the entire history of mankind including a profound societal change that is now taking its toll on most countries, rich and poor alike. Shrinking of capable labor force coinciding with the expanding share of elderly and retired citizens continues to happen as a long-term trend. Thus, long-term financial sustainability of public social and health insurance funds becomes more and more questionable. Health expenditure growth continues to accelerate worldwide, with increases mostly on demand side. To a large extent, it is attributable to the needs of elderly citizens for home-based medical care. Last year of life phenomenon confirmed that almost entire life span medical consumption of an individual citizen is equal to the last 12Â months of costs of treatment of expensive autoimmune, malignant, or vascular diseases. Most national and transnational authorities seem to be forced to consider reform of the current healthcare financing pattern inherited from the demographic growth era. Such exit strategy is necessary to make the financial burden of population aging bearable for modern-day universal health coverage and retirement policies. Ultimately, without bottom-up rethinking of universal health coverage and social support legacies, burden of global population aging might remain virtually unbearable for the most of modern societies.",

		"abstract": "This study aimed to assess flour and noodle qualities after substituting Phitsanulok rice flour (PH) with red Jasmine rice flour (RJ). Blended rice flours were prepared by replacing PH with RJ at various ratios [100:00 (0RJ), 75:25 (25RJ), 50:50 (50RJ), 25:75 (75RJ), and 00:100 (100RJ)]. Some quality improvements were observed in the blended rice flour in terms of chemical and pasting properties at the replacement ratio of 75:25 (pthinspace<thinspace0.05). At the same ratio, total phenolic contents, antioxidance activites, and some textural and sensory properties of noodle were developed (pthinspace<thinspace0.05). However, increasing values of some undesirable properties including cooking loss and rehydration were also observed (pthinspace<thinspace0.05). The noodle made from 100RJ showed the highest level of acceptability but not significantly different compared with others (pthinspace>thinspace0.05). Thus, RJ could be used to improve the nutritional value of rice flour, and it could be used for development of health benefits in rice noodle.",
